<h3>What am I looking at?</h3>
<p>This is a verbal profile of two newspaper comic strips. One, <i>Garfield</i>, has been telling the story of a lazy fat cat who hates Mondays for thirty-five years. Jim Davis, creator of <i>Garfield</i>, has freely <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/assessment/2004/06/garfield.html">admitted</a> <i>Garfield</i> was "a conscious effort to come up with a good, marketable character". Between $750 million and $1 billion in <i>Garfield</i> merchandise is sold each year.</p>
<p><i>Calvin & Hobbes</i> ran for just over 10 years. The strip follows a boy and his stuffed tiger, both named for Renaissance-era thinkers. Despite the marketing potential of such a character, cartoonist Bill Watterson <a href="http://bob.bigw.org/ch/interview.html">refused</a> to allow licensed merchandise because it would be a "detriment to the integrity of the strip". A plush Hobbes doll would answer a question that shouldn't be answered - is Hobbes alive?</p>
<h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>I ran a text analysis on a full transcript of <i>Calvin & Hobbes</i> and a transcript of three years of <i>Garfield</i>. To perform this analysis, I checked each word in a strip against the <a href="http://www.kovcomp.co.uk/wordstat/RID.html">Regressive Imagery Dictionary</a> (RID). The RID contains some 3,000 English words divided into two main "processes" - Primary and Secondary. These processes are further divided into categories. The primary process involves more basic concepts like food, sex, and sensation; the Secondary process covers more developed concepts like time, morality, social behavior, emotions, and abstract thought.</p>
<p>From this, I was able to get a percentage breakdown of word categories in each strip. Interpretation of these results was based on a <a href="https://proxy.library.upenn.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=keh&AN=5262888&site=ehost-live">psychological study</a> that found creativity was correlated with higher usage of words in the Primary process category. The top ten subcategories for each comic strip are also visualized. Hovering over a face shows all the words in that subcategory; words in black are found in both the RID and that comic strip's transcript.</p>
