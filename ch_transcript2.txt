Here we find a thriving city: brand new buildings a bustling economy. A scenic thoroughfare winds through this happy municipality. Here a farmer drives his livestock to market. Tragically this serene metropolis lies directly beneath the Hoover dam...

Bad news dad. Your polls are way down. My polls? You rate especially low among tigers and six-year-old white males. If you want to stay Dad Id suggest you adopt some key planks to your platform.

Flowers are pretty stupid. See its a bright sunny day out right? Well with this watering can I can make them think its raining. Its fun to mess with their minds.
19/07/86
The experiment has gone horribly wrong! Calvin has mutated into a giant fly! He zips about in parasitic hunger searching for decaying flesh! An unbearable stench fills the air. The hideous bug zeroes in. Mmm! This makes me hungry! Dont be gross. Just take out the garbage like I asked you will you please?
20/07/86
Its another new morning for Mr. Monroe. He glances at the newspaper headlines over a cup of coffee and gets in his red sports car to go to work. Little does he realize its his last day on the face of the earth! Calvin drinks the magic elixer and begins an incredible transformation. Instantly he grows! Bigger and bigger! Higher and higher! He is now over 300 feet tall! The formula is a success! Calvin the mighty giant goes on a terrible rampage striking fear into the hearts of the populace! Nothing can stop him! Its panic in the streets! A town lies in ruins! No I wont buy you any more toy cars. I saw you! You deliberately stomped on those!
21/07/86
Cmon Calvin! I signed you up for swimming lessons. I dont want swimming lessons!! Too late. Lets go. What about Hobbes? Did you sign him up too? No its not good to get tigers wet. Why is that? It takes us all day to dry and until we do we smell funny.
22/07/86
I cant believe my mom signed me up for swimming lessons. Here I am freezing my buns off at 9 in the morning about to jump into ice water and drown. The only thing that could possibly make this worse would be if the class was ... taught by my sadistic baby sitter!! Well look whos here!
23/07/86
Ok ... everyone in the water! I refuse! Im freezing already! Calvin do you know what a Rat Tail is? No. its when you soak a towel and twist it up into a whip. It stings like crazy and is much worse than being cold. Get my drift? I always though lifeguards were just taught how to resuscitate people and things like that.
24/07/86
This water is freezing! Im going to go into shock and drown I just know it. I bet the lifeguard is involved in some insurance scam and shes going to let us all drown like rats! Oh no! oh no! ok first were going to learn the deadmans float. Mom!! Helpp! Helpp! What I put up with to pay for college.
25/07/86
I dont want to learn how to swim! I dont need to know how. Ill just stay on dry land all my life. What if you fall out of a boat? No big deal.
26/07/86
Forty minutes of terror! Why did you sign me up for this? Why not something fun. Like hang gliding or sharpshooting? Or driving lessons! I could be taking driving lessons and learning something useful! How about piano lessons? You start Tuesday? Ack! No no no no no no no no no.
27/07/86
Hey mom are you nervous? No ... why? Calvin go outside and quit bugging me! Calvin the bug buzzes off! Flying low over the grass he searches for dead meat! Up and over the flowers darting this way and that! Oh no! hes caught in a spider web! Thrashing about in a desperate bid for freedom he only becomes more entangled! Soon the spider will suck out his innards! Help! I was going to join you in the hammock but I think Ill forget it.
28/07/86
Hi Calvin what are you doing? Big important secret things! Go away! Get lost! All right dandelion head! Who cares what you do anyway! Were doing great things. Were having fun! I thought we were bored out of our skulls. Oh hush. You dont know anything.
29/07/86
That stupid Calvin. Hes so mean. All I try to do is be friends and he treats me like Im nobody. Well who needs jerks like him anyway? I dont need him for a friend. I can have fun by myself! Poop!
30/07/86
Susie Hobbes thought I was rude so Im sorry and you can come play with us if you want. Thanks Calvin. Thats really nice of you. Ok well play house now. Ill be the high-powered executive wife the tiger here can be my unemployed housekeeping husband and you can be our bratty and brainless kid in a day care center. This was your idea pea brain. Dont you talk to your father that way! Im off to wall street. Dont wait up.
31/07/86
The aliens are gaining on our hero! In a surprise move Spaceman Spiff shifts into reverse! The aliens roar ahead! Spiff shifts back into forward and pursues the aliens! ... but the aliens have turned around and are headed straight for our hero! Spiff shifts into reverse! Im getting sick.
01/08/86
Whack! Tell me this isnt a spitball!!
02/08/86
Hobbes quick! How do I stop?!? Steer into a gravel driveway and fall down! Skrunch! That was only a suggestion.
03/08/86
Boy its quiet around here today! Too quiet! Ha ha! Gotcha! Hey! ... rrrrrr ... squeak. Whoosh! Ha ha! Gotcha back! Hey! Sploosh! A water balloon! That dirty tiger escalated the war! This calls for supreme retaliation! Ill get him with the garden hose! Nothing can beat a hose for sheer volume of water! ... unless of course he went so far as to ...
04/08/86
Look at that thing in the dirt! It must be a fossil! I wonder what peculiar animal this was. But its not a bone. It must be some primitive hunting weapon or eating utensil for cave men. Maybe it had some religious function. This explains why your clothes stay on the floor.
05/08/86
Making a sign? Im declaring the creek back in the woods Calvins creek. When you discover something youre allowed to name it and put up a sign. But suppose you didnt discover that creek. Of course I did! Nobody else has a sign there right?
06/08/86
Can Hobbes and I go play in the rain Mom? No. why not? Youll get soaked. Whats wrong with that? You could catch pneumonia run up a terrible hospital bill linger a few months and die. I always forget. If you ask a mom you get a worse-case scenario. I had no idea these little showers were so dangerous.
07/08/86
Want to go spelunking with me? Spelunking? There arent any caves around here! You dont need a cave. All you need is a rock. Spelunk!
08/08/86
Well dad off to work? Too bad Im on summer vacation so I get to stay home and do whatever I want. Well go off and join the rat race! Mom and I are racking up lots of expenses! Oog. I just do that to help him appreciate the weekends more.
09/08/86
Hot day isnt it? Ill say. But its the humidity that really gets to me. You dont like it when its humid? Not at all. Then youd better get out quick.
10/08/86
Go on three ok? One ... Two ... Two and a half ... Ready ... Set ... Go! Pit Pat Pit Pat Pit Pat Pit Pat. Pittida Dittida Pittida Dittida. Chooga Chooga Chooga. Eeewyeeowww. Gasp. I cant believe it! No sonic boom! Not even a pop! I heard a pop. But I think it was my lungs.
11/08/86
Whats for dinner? Salmon. Salmon?! Blecchh!! Calvin one of these days your face is going to freeze like that. Wow!
12/08/86
Hi Hobbes! Good heavens whats wrong with you? Mom said if I keep making this face it will freeze like this forever! You really think so? Its worth a try ... Ill bet my features are hardening already. I always liked gargoyles.
13/08/86
Dont make faces at the table Calvin. I cant help it. Mom said my face would freeze like this some day and it just did. No it didnt. it did dad! Mom was right Im horribly disfigured for life. No you arent. but dont worry I wont spoil dinner. See? Elephant man!
14/08/86
Here comes Susie. Ha! Wont she be horrified to see how our faces have tragically frozen! Hi Susie. Hi Calvin. What did you do get your head stuck in a blender? Its an improvement.
15/08/86
Are the coals hot? Yes theyre very hot Im just about to put on the hamburgers. Before you do could you toss in the can of lighter fluid and make a giant fireball? Ive got the most boring dad in the world.
16/08/86
With these snorkels we can stay under the water indefinitely. Just think of all the fish well be able to see! We can collect shells! Lets go! Well so far this has been a major disappointment.
17/08/86
You know Dad. It disturbs me that this wagon has no seat belts and wouldnt survive a 30 MPH impact with a stationary object. Um ... why do you bring this up? Oh no reason. Want to help me test the theory of relativity? Sure. The idea is that the faster we go the slower time goes. Gotcha. Its 10:23. What time is it now? 10:24. Go faster. Were going pretty fast! What time is it? 10:25 time still hasnt stopped. Has time stopped now? No just my heart. Well it looks like Einsteins a fraud wouldnt you say? No hes right! Look my watch isnt going at all any more!!
18/08/86
Add two eggs and stir. Right. The recipe says it makes twenty pancakes so well each get ten. Nah thats too much trouble. Well just make one big pancake and cut it in half.
19/08/86
Dad I want a bedime story! Im busy Calvin Ill read you one tomorrow. If you dont read me a story I wont go to bed! Once upon a time there was a boy named Calvin who always wanted things his way. One day his dad got sick of it and locked him in the basement for the rest of his life. Everyone else lived happily ever after. The end. I dont like these stories with morals.
20/08/86
Dinners ready Calvin. Come to the table. Im watching television. No youre not! Yes I am. Im right here in front of it! No youre not! Oh thats right. Im at the table.
21/08/86

22/08/86
Can I ride in a grocery cart? I think youre a little big for that now. Please?? All right. Up you go. Oh boy! Now run down the aisle and let go!
23/08/86
Aawweeawweeaaw! The water looked a little cold eh Tarzan?
24/08/86
Wanna toss the ol pigskin around? Heck no. Phooey. The center snaps the ball! The quarterback looks for an opening! The defense disintegrates beneath the coming onslaught! The quarterback jumps and dodges! Hobbes breaks clear! Calvin passes! An amazing catch! Hobbes is at the 30 ... the 20 ... the 10 ... but hes tackled from behind and laterals to Calvin so he can make the touchdown! But Calvin fumbles the ball and Hobbes recovers it! But a penalty is called on the play and Hobbes is sent to the bench! Hobbes defects to the other team and is greeted with enthusiastic cheers! The crowd goes wild! Calvin prepares to cripple the traitor with an illegal face mask pull! Hobbes defies him by pouring out of his mouth guard onto Calvin helmet! Boy you can see why football is such a violent game! Hobbes team gains a yard! All the cheerleaders come out for smooches!!
25/08/86
I think Im using too strong a sun screen.
26/08/86
Fishing is the most boring sport in the world. Weve been sitting here for twenty minutes and not one thing has happened! Waaughh!
27/08/86
Youre on my half of the bed! Move over! Your side is way over there! Give me back those covers! Calvin be quiet and go to sleep!! You heard Dad. He said to get on your side and leave the covers alone. Thats not what he said! Hey! You stole my pillow! This lumpy one is yours!
28/08/86
With a drink of magic elixir Calvin turns himself invisible. Completely transparent he roams undetected! Calvin? Boy as soon as you want something done around here that kids nowhere to be seen.
29/08/86
Ha ha! I have turned myself invisible! By removing my clothing I can perpetrate any crime undetected! I have complete freedom! I can get away with anything! Calvin! What on earth are you doing in the cookie jar without your clothes on?!?
30/08/86
Your polls are slipping Dad. Better get with it. Calvin being your Dad is not an elected position. I dont have to respond to pools. Not elected? You mean you can govern with dictatorial impunity? Exactly. In short open revolt and exile is the only hope for change? I dont like the direction this conversation is taking.
31/08/86
Gravity is arbitrary! Calvin wakes up one day to find he is immune to the force of gravity. He hangs on to the ground for dear life but his grip is weakening! He cant hold on! He ... he lets go! Aaaaa. Higher and higher as upward he falls! Only by grabbing the tail pin of a passing jet does Calvin save himself from being hurled out into space! No no let him finish. This is very interesting so after you landed in Phoenix what happened? Well I dont care. Im not sewing velcro on the outside of all his clothes. Well about then my gravity came back so I ...
01/09/86
Im going to learn how to ride this bicycle even if it kills me. Ok you can let go ... aaugh! Did it kill you? Not yet. Its decided to maim me first.
02/09/86
They say once you learn how to ride a bicycle you never forget. That doesnt surprise me. Waarrgh! It works on the same principle as electroshock therapy.
03/09/86
Easy ... easy ... hold it still ... there! Look! I did it! Im balancing! Thats good. Do you want to try it with the kickstand up?
04/09/86
Crash! It jumped me!!
05/09/86
Look theres a frog! Cmon lets catch it! Im not getting near it. Why not? They drink water all day just in case someone picks them up.
06/09/86
Im going to hang around the drugstore all afternoon and eat candy and read comic books! Oh no youre not! Why not?! Because Im your mother and I said so. Get back in here. And you can stop goose-stepping around the house!
07/09/86
Do you think boogeymen really exist? I dont know. ... but if they do Im sure this is where they live. That was the creepiest campfire story Ive ever heard. Lets get back to the tent! I dont think Ill ever sleep again. Shh! What? Did you hear something?? Didnt you? I dont know. What did it sound like? Sort of like breathing and drooling and ripping the meat off human bones. Yaahhhh. You were right. Im glad we carried a generator all this distance.
08/09/86
Hey Mom. Can we go out for pizza tonight? No we had pizza last night and besides its too expensive to eat out all the time. Oh youd rather blow the evening cooking and washing dishes than spend a few bucks? It seems like we go out for pizza a lot these days. If youd rather fix a dish of cereal at home be my guest. Hobbes wants triple anchovies.
09/09/86
Calvin and his trusty navigator Hobbes roar down the residential road at 90 MPH! Hobbes puts on the turn signal. Faster and faster they go! A busload of school children dives from the sidewalk! Hobbes puts on the windshield wipers. The police are after them! Calvin crawls down to put in the clutch and shift! Hobbes steers and blows the horn! All right Im back already! Cant I even run an errand without you blowing the horn across the parking lot?! It was Hobbes Mom not me.
10/09/86
See any UFOs? Not yet. Well keep your eyes peeled. Theyre bound to land here sooner or later. What will we do when they come? See if we can smell Mom and Dad into slavery for a star cruiser.
11/09/86
Z. Yawn! Ta daa! Sheesh.
12/09/86
Calvin I dont want you up in that ree. Why not? Some of the branches are dead and they might break. Come on down. Mom spoils everything. This isnt quite the same is it?
13/09/86
Gloonk! Gloonk! Calvin drink your milk in little sips!
14/09/86
Spaceman Spiff is hit! Hes going down! Fortunately our hero always buckles up! The fearless Spaceman Spiff has crashed on a distant world! The planets atmosphere is thick with noxious fumes and gases! Our hero can hardly breathe. Spiff must find help quickly ... but is there any life on this hostile world? His question is answered when a hideous blob of of gelatinous muck oozes out of a crevice toward him! Spiffs blaster is useless against the slime! Our hero tries to escape but the suffocating stench envelops him! What a disgusting fate! Yechh! I sure wish Id brought my lunch today! Thats gross Calvin! If you dont like the cafeterias tapioca just leave it alone!
15/09/86
Summer vacations over! Nothing ahead but toil and drudgery for a whole year! Oh come on you spent half the summer complaining how bored you were. I did? You did. How strange. I must have been delirious from having so much fun.
16/09/86
I cant believe it! Homework already! I just got back to school! I have to write a paragraph on what I did over the summer! A whole paragraph!! Ill never be able to write that much! Its not fair!! Hows it coming? Not so good. What did you do besides watch TV?
17/09/86
In soccer you cant touch the ball with your hands or arms. See you can use any other part of your body ... even your head! Yeah but your face?? Doesnt that that hurt? Rrrrghh! Thats not what I meant to do!
18/09/86
I have a hypothetical question. Suppose a kid at school called me a nasty name ... should I kick him real hard in the shins? No I dont think violence would be justified. Heres another hypothetical question. What if I already did?
19/09/86
Ive decided to grow a beard Mom. A long beard like the guys in ZZ Top. Thats nice Calvin. You go ahead and do that. I thought shed put up more of a fuss than that.
20/09/86
How about these pants Mom? Can I get these? Good heavens look at the price! I dont have pants that cost this much! And youll grow right out of these! Honestly why would any kid need designer clothes?? Babes. Babes Mom. I gotta look cool.
21/09/86
Dont turn out the light Dad! You didnt check under the bed for monsters! Im sure there are no monsters under your bed go to sleep. Good night. Good-bye. Any monsters under my bed tonight? Theres no answer. Do you think theyre gone? Maybe theyre just staying queit. Keep watch over the side of the bed. Boy am I full! I mustve gained ten pounds today! Maybe Im getting a little plump! Youre bigger Calvin but theres no fat on you! I guess youre right. Im getting big but Im still nice and lean! Ugh. Something under the bed is drooling. Start tying the sheets together. Well go out the window.
22/09/86
Pay up squirt. Forget it Moe. Im not giving you the money. In fact I dont even have any. Gee thats too bad. Oh wait yes I do! Here. For a kid with a monosyllabic vocabulary hes awfully persuasive.
23/09/86
Ok Hobbes heres the plan to put Moe out of commission. You come to school with me and when Moe comes to steal my money you jump out and eat him! Eat him?? I couldnt do that! Sure you could! Whats wrong with that?! Fat kids are high in cholesterol. Well just chew him up and spit him out I dont care!!
24/09/86
If that bully is extorting money Im going to call the school and put an end to it. Dont do that! If Moe finds out I squealed Im a goner! This kid cant get away with stealing Calvin. Somebodys got to do something. Heres a list of what Im wearing. See you at the morgue.
25/09/86
Hey Twinkie heres the 2 cents I borrowed from you the other day. Somebody ratted on me and its gonna be a dark day if I ever find out who! I think Ill use the quarter to call my insurance agent.
26/09/86
Hi Dad its me! Calvin is this important? Im very busy this morning. Ill make it fast Dad. Can you pick up some topsoil and grass seed on your way home? Ok. Sure. Goodbye.
27/09/86
Ring Ring. Hello Calvin speaking. Id like to order a large anchovy pizza. What? I ... ?? oh Im sorry. You must have dialed the wrong number. Goodbye. I try to make everyones day a little more surreal.
28/09/86
Quit squirming Calvin. Youve got ice cream all over your shirt. Rats I was saving it for later. Thanks for the ice cream Dad. It was great. Youre welcome. Im tired of pulling you. Its my turn to ride. Your Dad didnt get me any ice cream so I get to ride both ways. No you dont! Dad said tigers dont like ice cream! Its my turn to ride! Tigers dont know if they like ice cream until they try every kind. Im not pulling. Ive got news fuzz brain. Im not pulling either! Well then I guess well both just sit here until we die. Why do these walks always end up as rides? oh you need the exercise more anyway.
29/09/86
What are you doing? Being cool. You look more like youre being bored. The world bores you when youre cool.
30/09/86

05/10/86
Im hungry whens lunch? Right now. Hi Susie! Oh look youve got your stuffed tiger! Can I squeeze him? What are you crazy? Hobbes is a ferocious man-eating jungle beast! Ferocious? He looks fuzzy and cuddly to me! Ha! Beneath that soft exterior lie terrible mandibles of bone crushing death! Hell grind you into hamburger! Each mighty paw hides razor-sharp claws to rip the living hide off any human that wanders too close! Hes a monster! No hes not. Hes a big cutie. Oh no! I cant look!! ... so what happened to the mandibles of death. You sissy furball?!? I was beguiled by her feminine charms. Yow. Go soak your head.
06/10/86
With great effort Calvin the human insect advances the paper in the typewriter. His only hope for proper medical treatment lies in his ability to write a legible message to his family! He craws to each key and jumps! Who wrote Help Im a bug on my letter to Grandma? Evidently some bug. How strange.
07/10/86
Back and forth. Back and forth. Tidal wave! Beats me Mom. Maybe the seal around the tub leaks.

12/10/86
Were there dinosaurs when you were a kid dad? Oh sure! Your grandfather and I used to put on our leopard skins and hunt Brontosaurus for all the clan rituals. Listen buster I think Calvins grades are bad enough already dont you? The horrifying Tyrannosaurus lumbers across the prehistoric valley. The mighty dinosaur is a walking death machine! Only one other creature dares to challenge the terrible Tyrannosaurus! ... the savage Saber-Toothed Tiger! Gg mmf yow gzzzz mkn gbzz yow. Wake up! The meek Tyrannosaurus victim of an innocent misunderstanding tears like heck across the prehistoric valley.
13/10/86

19/10/86
Now where did all the bed pillows go? This is gonna be soft! Krunch! Hey Hobbes! Cmon and jump in the leaves! Its fun! I dont know sometimes slugs hide under leaves. No they dont. Do they? Slugs? Ugh just imagine one of those slimy muckballs slipping up your pant leg! There might be dozens in there! There might? Aack ick ooh yecch! Thats the problem with nature. Somethings always stinging you or oozing mucous on you. Lets go watch TV. Is it 3 oclock yet? We can watch The Blob!
20/10/86

You didnt officially call a time out. Off to jail with you! Forget it! From now on if you are discussing a new rule its automatically a time out. Ok time in! Tag! You cant do that! We have to say time in together! Since when?? Youre just changing rules so youll win! I am not! Im just trying to keep you from cheating! Just a minute. Muffin head. Are you calling me a cheater?

27/10/86
Look mom. I put all my clothes for tomorrow on the stairs. Then in the morning Ill run out in my underwear and slide down at top speed! If I aim good I go right into my pants while Im putting on my shirt and by the bottom Im all dressed for school. And if you put my cereal on the stairs too I wont have to get up until 30 seconds before the bus comes. Forget it Calvin.
28/10/86
Ack. Igg. Look mom Ive got rabies. Go spit out your toothpaste and stop being silly. Maybe dad will fall for it if I bite him first.
29/10/86
What are you going to dress up as for Halloween? I dont know yet I cant decide. Well the idea is to be the scariest thing you can think of. Hmm ... maybe Ill just go as myself! Im going as a barrel of toxic waste!
30/10/86
Were going to carve a Jack-Olantern now. See well make a face on this pumpkin so it will look like a head. But first we have to open up the top and scoop out the glop inside. Ok Jack time for your lobotomy!! Hand me a big spoon. Will you Hobbes? Ugh? No anesthetic even.
31/10/86
I think Dad likes Halloween as much as we do. Is he taking us trick or treating tonight? No Mom is. Is he going to stay home and give out candy? No hes going to sit in the bushes with the garden hose and drench potential tpers.
01/11/86
Oog. I feel awful. If someone even mentions Milk Duds. Im going to barf. Another Halloween come and gone. Its always such a letdown after a holiday. We might as well go into town and look at the Christmas decorations.
02/11/86
Enemy sighted! Battle stations! Battle stations! Alert! Ahwooga! Heres the mighty aircraft carrier! Equipped with the latest radar and firepower. It is virtually unsinkable! I know what can sink it.

Ill go see what your kid is doing. My did?!? Cmere and let me explain something to you ...

Hi Mom! Since youre sick. Im bringing you breakfast in bed! I prepared eggs toast and orange juice for you all by myself! How nice! The eggs kind of burned and stuck to the pan but you can probably chip them out with this chisel. Um ... where is the toast and orange juice? Dad said not to tell you about that till your better.
05/11/86
Since your Moms sick. Ill be making dinner tonight. You can cook? As you can see I survived two years of my own cooking when I had an apartment after college. Mom says you ate frozen waffles and canned soup three meals a day. Your Mom wasnt there so she wouldnt know. Get the syrup out will you?
06/11/86
Sometimes when Im sick you read me a story want me to read you one? No thanks Calvin. I just want to rest. Its hard to be a Mom for a Mom. You do fine sweetie. Whoa! Hey! Are you contagious?!

08/11/86
I asked dad if mom was going to have a baby and he said not that he knew of. Dad said wed know if mom was having a kid because shed look like a hippopotamus with a gland problem. ... thats when Mom creamed him with her pillow. Dad says she must be feeling better. You have weird parents.

25/11/86
Ta-daaa!!

How do they know the load limit on bridges Dad? They drive bigger and bigger trucks over the bridge until it breaks. Then they weigh the last truck and rebuild the bridge. Oh. I shouldve guessed. Dear if you dont know the answer. Just tell him!
27/11/86
Its hard to believe people still starve in this world. Theres even hunger in America. Some people never get enough to eat. Boy I know what thats like! No you dont.
28/11/86
The soldiers advance up the hill! Oh no! a squadron of bombers appears on the horizon! The bombs begin to fall! Bonk bonk. Two direct hits! I see you up there!
29/11/86
Look Hobbes you get a plastic trinket in boxes of Chocolate-Frosted Sugar Bombs! It says Be the first in your neighborhood to collect all ten colors. Yeah but Mom says she wont buy any more cereal until this box is gone. That shouldnt take more than a couple of hours right? I dunno after five bowls I get pretty wired.
30/11/86
A brilliant bolt of deadly frap ray blazes by the intrepid Spaceman Spiff! Our hero has very high insurance premiums. The courageous Spaceman Spiff is hit! He plummets toward planet Zog! Breaking through the cloud layer he careens over an alien city! Theres no place to land! Spiff wrestles the uncooperative controls! More freem drive to the thuster busters! Too much stress! The fuel explodes in flame! The situation is grim! Ten seconds to impact! Nine ... eight ... Well Calvin?? Seven! Very good Calvin. Ten minus three equals seven.

Will you read us this story? Hobbes wrote it himself. Hobbes wrote it huh? Goldilocks and the three tigers. Oh boy this is gonna be great! Once upon a time there lived a young girl named Goldilocks. She went into the forest and saw a cottage. No one was home so she went in. Inside she saw three bowls of porridge. A big bowl a medium bowl and a small bowl. She was just about to taste the porridge when the three tigers came home. They quickly divided Goldilocks into big medium and small pieces and dunked them in the porridge that ...

12/12/86
Bad news on your polls Dad. You slipped another two notches. Things are looking grim for future office. Is that so? Any ideas on what would improve my standings? I need a VCR. Right Ill keep that in mind. I hope youre reading the Help Wanted Section.
13/12/86
Look I got a letter Im supposed to copy and send to 20 people for good luck. Its a chain letter. It says A man in Denver made 20 copies and the next day he got a raise. A man in Seattle broke the chain and he went bald. Ha! You believe that? These letters are for superstitious nincompoops. Throw it away. ... and a dumb kid like you listened to a friend and got run over by a cement mixer.
14/12/86

Why do I have to go to bed now? I never get to do what I want! If I grow up to be some sort of psychopath because of this youll all be sorry!! Nobody ever became a psychopath because he had to go to bed at a reasonable hour. Yeah but you wont let me chew tobacco either! You never know what might push me over the brink! Go to bed Calvin.
21/12/86
Run! Aiee! Look out! I wonder why Japanese people keep moving their moths after theyre through talking. Somewhere in the Pacific Ocean ... an undersea nuclear explosion awakens a giant prehistoric monster! It makes its way to the coast of Japan and emerges! Yaarghhh. He heads for the power lines leaving a trail of destruction behind. Calvin get back in the tub! Youre making a mess! His ancient arch-rival Megalon! He spews a mighty fireball! Aauughh! Tokyo is in ruins! Megalon vanquished! He returns to the sea from whence he came! No more afternoon TV movies for you! ... Ever!!
22/12/86
Oh boy you got some clay. Im making Mom and Dad a Christmas present. What are you making? An ashtray. Your parents dont smoke. Of course ... ok Michalengelo you sculpt something!
23/12/86
A homemade gift says more than a store-bought gift. It says you care enough to invest your time and skill in it. It says this is a personal gift not a generic one. It says you need a bigger allowance.
24/12/86
This article says that many people find Christmas the most stressful time of the year. I believe it. This season sure fills me with stress. Really? How come? I hate being good.
25/12/86
Psst! Are you awake? Is it Christmas? It is! It is! Lets go wake Mom and Dad and open all our loot! Since its Christmas maybe we should let them sleep a little. Thats long enough! Wake up! Wake up! Its Christmas!! Quarter to 6. He let us sleep in this year.
26/12/86
Omigosh! This library book was due two days ago! What will they do? Are they going to interrogate me and beat me up?! Are they going to break my knees?? Will I have to sign some confession?? Theyll fine you ten cents now go return it. The way some of those librarians look at you. I naturally assumed the consequences would be more dire.
27/12/86
Hey Dad I have a question. Sure Calvin. What do you want to know? If you plugged up your nose and mouth right before you sneezed ... would the sneeze go out your ears or would your head explode? I was kind of hoping you had a math problem or something. ... either way. Im scared to try it.
28/12/86
Toboggans give better rides than runner sleds. Why is that? Theres no way to steer. On these cloudy winter days sometimes I like to lie back on my sled and look at the sky. Its just gray and silent. No birds singing or bugs buzzing. Everything is muffled by the snow. Imagine what it would be like without any people or houses around. It would be perfectly still. Pretty neat huh? Yes very peaceful. I hate all that silence.
29/12/86
Behold the dreaded toboggan: suicide sled. Its unique design sends a blinding spray of snow on its passengers at the slightest bump. Note too the lack of any steering mechanism. Yes this sled is truly a hazard to life and limb. Wheee! Oomph!
30/12/86
Boy is it cold! Cant we turn the heat up? Heat is expensive Calvin. Just put on a sweater. Look the thermostat goes all the way up to 90 degrees! We could be sitting around in our shorts. Leave the thermostat alone Calvin. I can almost see my breath. Ill just crank it up to 75 ok? I said dont touch it. Gee my hands are so numb I cant move the switch. Guess Ill put on a sweater.
31/12/86
Ooh. You look cold Calvin! Theres a fire made. Why dont you go warm up? Oh boy! Nothing beats sitting by a roaring fire after youve been out in the cold. Of course some people say why bother going outside first?
01/01/87
Calvin I hope you took your boots off before you walked across the floor. Of course I did! You dont need to tell me all the time!
02/01/87
Given any more thought to that backyard ski lift proposal of mine? Oh yes. Lots.
03/01/87
Hobbes is always a little loopy when he comes out of the dryer.
04/01/87
What a day! And no one to share it with! Woo hoo hoo. Its cold out there today! Brrrr! Brisk! Just the way I like it! Wow! Sniff. Ha! Weather like this lets you know youre alive! Cmon out gang! Its a perfect day! Youll get used to the wind if you keep moving! Hey Cmon! are you guys just going to stay inside all day?!? Shut the dumb door!! Ok ok! I was on my way back outside anyway! ... sheesh ... theres one in every house. Just how long did you know Dad before you married him?
05/01/87
Watcha doin? Im writing my autobiography. But youre just six years old. Ive only got one sheet of paper.
06/01/87
Hi Hobbes. are you reading that book I gave you? Yes. Its very good. You like it? Sure I think its ... wait a minute. Would you mind writing it in two pages for me by tomorrow morning?
07/01/87
Mom was I adopted? No why do you ask? Are you planning to put me to work in a cannery for fourteen hours a day when I turn seven? Of course not! Youre not just fattening me up to eat me are you? Good heavens Calvin! Who put all these ridiculous ideas in your head?!? Thats right. Ridiculous ideas she called them. Oh sure you think your moms going to tell you?
08/01/87
Whifffff whiff whiff whiff whiff whiff. For all that preparation you sure are a lousy shot.
09/01/87
Go ahead down. Youll miss all those trees. You can do it. Youll stop before you go over that ledge at the bottom. You wont go into that pond. Besides the ice is probably real thick anyway. Go ahead down. My brain is trying to kill me.
10/01/87
Galosh. Galosh. Galosh.
11/01/87
Boy is this hill big! Well have a good long ride down! Provided we improve our steering. Hobbes do you think human nature is good or evil? Watch out for those trees. I mean do you think people are basically good with a few bad tendencies or basically bad with a few good tendencies? Theres a rock up ahead! Look out! Or as a third possibility. Do you think people are just crazy and who knows why they do anything? Not so close to the ledge! Well? What do you think? Are people good bad or crazy? Aughh! I cant look! Wump! You know its very rude of you to keep changing the subject after every sentence. I choose crazy.
12/01/87
I called Susie a boogerbrain after school and she went home crying. Goodness whyd you do that? I dunno I was just teasing. It sounds like you hurt her feelings. I didnt mean for her to take the insult personally!
13/01/87
Sniff. That stupid Calvin. What does he call me names for no reason? Its just mean. I wish I had a hundred friends. Then I wouldnt care. Id say Who needs you Calvin? Ive got a hundred other friends! Then my hundred friends and I would go do something fun and leave Calvin all alone! Ha! ... and as long as Im dreaming Id like a pony.
14/01/87
I feel bad that I called Susie names and hurt her feelings. Im sorry I did it. Maybe you should apologize to her. I keep hoping theres a less obvious solution.
15/01/87
Sticks and stones may break my bones. But words will never hurt me. Yeah right.
16/01/87
Um ... hi Susie ... I ... uh ... well ... Get lost Calvin. Youre mean. Dont walk away! Im trying to apologize you dumb noodleloaf! Slap!
17/01/87
Susie Im sorry I called you names. I didnt mean to hurt your feelings. Well you did hurt my feelings. But I accept your apology. Thank you. Oh boy thank goodness I got that over with! ... on second thought lets see you grovel a little bit!
18/01/87
Should I or shouldnt I? Too late! I did. Wap! Did you throw a snowball at me?! Me? A snowball? Did someone throw a snowball at you? Oh dont play innocent with me you liar! I know you threw that! Call me a liar. Will you? Well it takes one to know one Mr. Tapioca head! Ooh! An insult! Ive been maligned! Ill never speak to you again! Hmph. Promises promises! Oh yeah? Twbbthbpthh! Yeah! Thbthbbptb! Thbppbpth! Thbbth! This is you: aggle aggle aggle! Oh yeah? This is you: gakka wakka wakka! Calvin time to come in! leave it to mom to interrupt our repartee. ... just when I had you wriggling in the crushing grip of reason too ...
19/01/87
Hey Hobbes you got a letter. A letter? For me? Wow. I never get letters! What fun! A letter for me! I wonder who sent it? I wonder what it says? What could this possibly be? Open it and find out you lunatic! Dont get huffy. I want to savor this.
20/01/87
Well? Well? Whatd you get? It looks like an invitation. An invitation? Whod invite you anywhere? A lot of people thats who buster. Theres obviously been some mistake nobody invites a tiger anywhere.

22/01/87
Well well! Its an invitation to Susie Derkins birthday party. How nice. Susie invited you? What about me? Does it say me too? No it doesnt say anything about you. She must have mailed my invitation separately she probably wanted to insure it so shell know it didnt get lost. Sometimes those take longer. Ill have to sign for it and all. Im sure shes taking no chances with mine. Oh wait. On the back it says You can bring that stupid kid you hang around with if you must.
23/01/87
We get to go to a birthday party! That stupid Susie. Balloons cake presents ... oh boy! She wont be getting a very big present from me thats for sure. I bet well play games too! It will be fun! Hmph. Maybe well play Spin the Bottle! Oh get real!

I think we should get her a can of tuna fish. Tuna fish? Why would she want that? Well maybe she wouldnt and we could offer to take it back ... and borrow some bread a little mayo ... right Hobbes.
25/01/87
Ha ha! Your clever little strategy has tragically backfired! Look at this jump! Watch and weep fuzz face! Thats your move right? I get to go now right? Its too late for you to change your mind right?

28/01/87

I saw one on the way over! Cmon! good thing I always carry a Swiss army knife. Nobodys coming right? Is this game legal?
29/01/87

04/02/87
Dad says my report card shows that not enough time is being spent on my homework. So from dinner till bed is now designated as homework time. I dont think thats fair! If it doesnt take that long to do why should I have to stay in my room all that time? Yeah can I help it Im so fast?

The giant amoebae slides along the kitchen floor. Extending a cytoplasmic pseudopod the protozoan engulfs a package of oatmeal cookies. Nice try. Put them back.
14/02/87
The majestic eagle circles slowly in the clouds. With eyes so sharp he can spot movement a mile below. He sights his prey and dives! Reaching speeds of more than 100 mph his unwary prize will never know what hit it! Wake up Dad! Its Saturday! Zz ... wha?
15/02/87
Here is success Mr. Jones. He lives an a 5 acre home in a wealthy suburb. Here is the new Mercedes in the driveway. Its anyones guess as to how much longer Mr. Jones can meet his monthly finance charges. Here comes Mr. Jones out of his attractive suburban home. He hops in his red sports car. Off he goes to work. 80 ... 90 ... 100 miles an hour! ... along the edge of the Grand Canyon!! Suddenly his steering wheel locks and he brakes fail! He careens over the edge! Oh no! Down he goes! His only hope is to climb out the sun roof and jump! Maybe just maybe he can grab a branch and save himself! He unwinds the sun roof! Can he make it? No! The car explodes in mid-air propelling millions of tiny shards into the stratosphere! Kablooie! The neighbors hear the boom echoing across the canyon. They pile into a mini-van to investigate! What will happen to them?
16/02/87
Dad did you do a mating dance when you first saw mom? A mating dance? Yeah I saw some birds do it on TV. They went awk awk braau-auukkk! yes thats more or less how I reacted. To what wise guy? ... think carefully.
17/02/87
Out you go Hobbes. into the dryer. Rrrrrr Ding! Goodness youre a fright. Tell your mom to put some conditioner in the wash next time.
18/02/87
I cleaned my room Mom. And I even did it without you telling me to. Well that was very thoughtful. Of course this isnt going to be a habit or anything.
19/02/87
How come it doesnt take you as long as Mom to vacuum the house? Maybe Im more efficient. Maybe you dont do as good a job. Why dont you go find something to do Mr. Critic? Ok can I take this dust ball in for show and tell tomorrow? Calvin this dust ball is going to be our little secret all right? Aaacck! Look at this thing! Dear I thought you did this room!
20/02/87
Ive been in the water about 20 minutes look at my fingers. Theyre all wrinkled! So are my toes! Pretty neat huh? Big pink raisin discovered in tub - boys whereabouts unknown! Aaugh!
21/02/87
For the next 60 seconds I will conduct a test of my emergency broadcast equipment. Aaaaaaaaghhhhhhhh! Had this been a real emergency the scream you just heard would have been followed by lots more just like it. This concludes my ... oh someday when the house caves in shell thank me. Mark my words.
22/02/87
Aaaaahhh! Eeee! Hee hee hee hee! Woo! Ack! Ive got you! Aaheeeee! Tickle tickle! Ah! Ah! Hee hee hee woo hoo! Im gonna getcha! Im coming after you! Eek! Hee hee. Here I come! Gotcha! Gootchie gootchie! Akpth! Ha ha ha. Eeep! Ha ha hee hee ooh! Ooh! Ha ha ha. Tickle tickle! Whoa! Whoa! Wed better stop. Calm down calm down. Ha ha hoo hoo hee hee ha. Hee hee whoof! Ha ha! (pant pant) hee hee hee wheeeeeeee ... her plan backfired Dad. Im all wound up and Mom needs to be put to bed.
23/02/87
Oh Mom I need Crisco for school today! Shortening? Honestly Calvin I wish youd remember these things the night before. Now hurry up and get ready. Right. Heres the Crisco back. Thanks. You put it in your hair?? Get back here! Youre not going to school like that! Aw cmon Mom! Its class picture day!
24/02/87
What with your hair? I told Mom Im getting my school picture taken today and she made me comb out the Crisco I put in my hair. Now I look like a moron. Thats true. You do. Well dont just stand there! Think of something! What can I do? There much better! Whatd you do is it cool? Is it new wave? Gee I wish I had a mirror.
25/02/87
The bus is going to be here any minute. Youre sure you fixed my hair so it looks ok? It looks great. Try not to muss it up. Youre not kidding me are you? This really looks good? Trust me. You look like ... like ... Astro boy. All right! I cant wait to get my picture taken now!
26/02/87
Calvin! What did you do to your hair?? Dont you know we have our pictures taken today? Of course silly. Thats why I did it. Its Crisco. Does your mom know you look like that? Sort of. Hobbes fixed me up a little bit at the bus stop. Wow. I wish I had some Crisco. Wait till Mom sends my picture to Grandma!
27/02/87
Ok kid sit up straight on the stool and look right at me. Thats it. Are you ready to take my picture? Should I take off my shirt now? Kid what are ... ? dont take off your shirt!! See? I painted a face on my stomach. Kid put your shirt back on. But look! When I breath out the face changes! See? Ok take one quick!
28/02/87
Look Hobbes I got my school pictures back. Look at you! Ha ha ha! Look at your hair! Hee hee! These are great! Arent they though? Hee hee hee! What an expression! Hoo hoo hoo! Ha ha! Yeah see how I got my one eye to roll back? Ha ha ha! Your mothers going to go into conniptions of course. Oh cmon. Years from now think of the memories these will bring.
01/03/87
Glik glik glik. Oh no! what have I done?!? The human body is 80% water. Little did Calvin realize how critical it is to maintain that! Now its too late! By drinking that extra glass of water Calvin has upset that precious balance! He is now 90% water! Everything solid in Calvins body begins to dissolve! He is becoming liquid!! His only hope is somehow to get to an icebox and freeze himself solid until he can get proper medical attention! Unfortunately as a liquid Calvin can only run downhill! Can he make it? Can he make it?? I dont think Im going to make it. Theres a gas station up ahead. Just hold on. Didnt I tell you not to drink so much before we left?!
02/03/87
Calvin how do you explain this test score? Its terrible! I didnt study for it. What do you mean you didnt study for it? Why not? I forgot. You forgot? How could you possibly forget?? What? Huh? Where am I? Who am I? Dont give me this amnesia stuff!
03/03/87
gee it was awfully nice of you strangers to have me over for dinner. Calvin knock it off. You mean me? Is my name Calvin? Youre not fooling anyone young man. You do not have amnesia. This all seems vaguely familiar ... and yet ... and yet ... youre asking for an early bedtime kid. Well he seems to remember he likes dessert anyway. This is dessert you say? Hmm ... perhaps my memory would return if I had some more. Thats it bed!
04/03/87
Ive had enough of this silly amnesia game. Since you wont stop it youre going to bed. You can let me know if you want to be serious. Wink. Aauughh! Mister theres a tiger in this room!!
05/03/87
Calvin all we want is for you to study and do your best in school education is very important. Thats why this amnesia game has to stop. No more forgetting to do your homework. Ok? Ok mister. Ok? ... uh Dad. Right Dad. You got it.
06/03/87
Im glad to see youre doing your homework. How is your math class going now? Um ... Im doing great. How great? Real great. Have you been passing all your quizzes? I didnt say phenomenal.
07/03/87
RING RING RING RING RI ... Its never for me and I hate taking messages.
08/03/87
IM HOME! AAUUGH! YAAAA! I thought that after seven boring hours at school I though you might appreciate one moment of pure abject terror. Let me up to get my bat and Ill thank you.
09/03/87
Hobbes look! Theres a little raccoon on the ground. Is it alive? I think so but hes hurt. See hes hardly breathing. Better not touch him if hes hurt. Yeah. You wait here and guard him. Ill run and get Mom. I sure hope she can help. Of course she can! You dont get to be Mom if you cant fix everything just right.
10/03/87
Theres Hobbes guarding him Mom. The little raccoons right over there! Ooh Calvin I dont know if we can save him. He looks pretty bad. Go get a shoe box and a clean dish towel. Right! I dont think this poor little guy is going to make it Hobbes (sigh) I hate it when these things happen. ... you can tell Im upset when I start talking to you.
11/03/87
Well I got him in the shoe box. I guess all we can do is keep him warm and safe. Well keep him in the garage and put out some water and food. I read in a book that raccoons will eat just about anything. Chances are Ill be happy to donate most of my dinner. Calvin you dont even know what were having.
12/03/87
Has he eaten anything? No. dont die little raccoon. It wouldnt be very grateful of you to break my heart.
13/03/87
I cant sleep. Me either. I keep thinking about the raccoon. I hope he lives. Me too. I think animals are always so cute.
14/03/87
Dad did you check on the little raccoon this morning? Yes Calvin. Im afraid he died. Waahhhh!! Im sorry too kiddo. But he didnt have much of a chance. Wahhhaahh! At least he died warm and safe Calvin. We did all could but now hes gone. Sniff. I know Im crying because out there hes gone but hes not gone inside me.
15/03/87
Heres a photo I took of you. The picture is kind of fuzzy. Youre kind of fuzzy! Ok make a face! Howth thith? Great! Hold it! Lets see! Lets see! Its developing! I can start to see it! There I am! Look! Look! Ha! Ha! Its great! What a photograph! Hee hee hoo hoo ha ha! Ha ha hee hee ho ho ho! Lets take some more! Thats it. Bug your eyes you! Hee hee! Hurry up! All these pictures are of Hobbes?! Arent they a scream? Can I have ten bucks for another roll of film?
16/03/87
This is where Dad buried the little raccoon. I didnt even know he existed a few days ago and now hes gone forever. Its like I found him for no reason. I had to say good-bye as soon as I said hello. Still ... in a sad awful terrible way Im happy I met him. Sniff. What a stupid world.
17/03/87
You know Hobbes I cant figure out this death stuff. Why did that little raccoon have to die? He didnt do anything wrong. He was just little! Whats the point of putting him here and taking him back so soon?!? Its either mean or its arbitrary and either way Ive got the heebie-jeebies. Why is it always night when we talk about these things?
18/03/87
Mom says death is as natural as birth and its all part of the life cycle. She says we dont really understand it but there are many things we dont understand and we just have to do the best we can with the knowledge we have. I guess that makes sense. But dont you go anywhere. Dont worry.
19/03/87
Hey! What happened to the trees here? Who cleared out the woods? There used to be lots of animals in these woods! Now its a mud pit! This sign says Future site of Shady Acres condominiums. Animals cant afford condos! Shady Acres? The only shade I see is from that bulldozer.
20/03/87
Where are all the animals supposed to live now that they cut down these woods to put in houses?? By golly how would people like it if animals bulldozed a suburb and put in new trees?!? No good they didnt leave the keys.
21/03/87
It took hundreds of years for these woods to grow and they leveled it in a week. Its gone. After they build new houses here theyll have to widen the roads and put up gas stations and pretty soon this whole area will just be a big strip. Eventually there wont be a nice spot left anywhere. I wonder if you can refuse to inherit the world. I think if youre born its too late.
22/03/87
Kablooie! Ooooh youve twicked me for the wast time wabbit! Ha ha ha! Boy I wish I had some dynamite! Boy I love weekends! What better way to spend ones freedom than eathing chocolate cereal and watching cartoons! Mm ... I beg to differ on the cereal part. Calvin youve been sitting in front of the stupid TV all morning! Its a beautiful day! You should be outside! Its going to be a grim day when the world is run by a generation that doesnt know anything but what its seen on TV! Hey! How can you sit inside all day? Go on! Out! Out! Kids are supposed to run around in the fresh air! Have some fun! Get some exercise! Slam! Well I guess thats that. Come on. Hi Susie are you watching TV? Can we come in? sure hurry up! Its a commercial.
23/03/87
Hobbes want to see my transmogrifier? I didnt know you had a transmogrifier. I just got it. You step into this chamber set the appropriate dials and it turns you into whatever youd like to be. Its amazing what they do with corrugated cardboard these days. Isnt it?
24/03/87
This transmogrifier will turn you into anything at all. All you do is set this indicator and the machine automatically restructures your chemical configuration. You can be an eel a baboon a giant bug or a dinosaur. What if you want to be something else? I left some room just write it on the side.
25/03/87
Well what do you say? Would you like to be transmogrified? I dont think so. Being a tiger is my area of expertise. Dont be scared. The process is instantaneous and completely painless. Just think! With the push of a button you could be a 500-story gastropod - a slug the size of the Chrysler building. Gosh how can I refuse? Well if you dont like that be something else! I dont care!
26/03/87
Look if you cant make up your mind Ill go first and turn myself into something. Ill show you. But whats the point of turning yourself into something else? No ones done it! Think of the knowledge to be gained. What horrors we visit upon ourselves in the name of science. Ok Im in. set the dial on lungfish ... no make it musk ox ... no ...
27/03/87
What are you going to transmogrify into? How about a tiger? Thats a good idea. The world can always use another tiger. Just turn the arrow and push the button then. All right here you go. Zap! Did it work? Boy Im hot. How do you stand having all this fur?
28/03/87
So youre a tiger now? Yep let me out. Words fail me. Im disappointed too but keep in mind transmogrification is a new technology.
29/03/87
Thanks for the lunch Mom! Im going outside. Refueled the 727 taxis onto the runway. Control tower to Calvin you are cleared for take off. Roger. Full throttle! Fwoooshh! Take off! Landing gear up! Chugunk! We have reached our crossing altitude of 30000 feet. A small tasteless snack will be served shortly. This is your captain speaking Im afraid our arrival will be slightly delayed. Were stacked up over Washington and well be in a holding pattern for another 40 minutes. Tower to Calvin you are now cleared for landing. Roger. Landing gear down! Reverse thrust! I saw you outside running in circles for almost an hour! Are you trying to make yourself sick?!? Oog from now on Im playing bus.
30/03/87
So Calvin whats it like to be a tiger now? Kinda fuzzy but not that different. So! What do you want to talk about? Do we eat soon?
31/03/87
Hi Mom! Will you make Hobbes and me a big tuna sandwich? I thought you hated tuna fish. Not anymore. Im a tiger now. I thought Hobbes was your tiger. Now Im one too. I transmogrified. Oh I see. My shes taking this well but the strain will surely crack her soon.
01/04/87
Im home! Hi Dad. Notice anything different about me? Uh ... new haircut? Geez did you go blind?? Im a tiger! Oh I thought you meant besides that. Calvin your Dads very tired and ... Hope you want tuna for dinner dear.
02/04/87
Well Hobbes its been fun but I dont think I was meant to be a tiger. Just set the dial to Calvin and Ill transmogrify back to a boy. Here you go. Zap! Oops! Try again lunkhead.
03/04/87
Here I am back being Calvin. Your machine works amazingly well. Its my own design. What will you do with it now? Good question. ... although I suppose we could turn Susie into a bowl of chowder if we could just get her into the machine. Leave me out of your lifes plans. You little weirdo.
04/04/87
Calvin eats one bite too many! He begins to swell! Inflating like a raft. He grows bigger and bigger! Oh no! how much larger can he get? Ooooh I think Im going to explode. No wonder! Ive never seen anyone eat so much in one sitting! I hope you learned your lesson.
05/04/87
Look Jane. See Spot. See Spot run. Run Spot run. Jane sees Spot run. Way to go Jane! Boy I hate homework. Yahh! Whoop! Hey! Yow! Whoa! Stop! Aaaughh!! Gaackk! Help! Help! Whap!! Bonk! Bonk! What on earth are you doing? Wheres your homework? I couldnt concentrate.
06/04/87
Rrinnggg! Recess is over! Rrripp! Oh no! why is it you always rip your pants on the day everyone has to demonstrate a math problem at the chalkboard?
07/04/87
I cant believe I ripped my pants! Recess is over. Im supposed to be back in class! I cant go in like this! What am I going to do?? ... of all the days to wear the underpants with little rocket ships.
08/04/87
Look at the size of this rip! Maybe I can pull my shirt down over it. No that doesnt work. Maybe I can tuck my shirt in the hole. ... nope ... maybe I can stick the ripped part under my belt. No that doesnt work either. Maybe I can scoot around on my rear the rest of the day.
09/04/87
Please dont let the teacher call on me! Dont make me go to the board in my ripped pants! Anyone but me! Just let her call on someone else! Please dont embarrass me in front of the whole class! Calvin would you do the next problem at the board? So much for my ever joining the clergy.
10/04/87
Calvin will you do the next problem at the board please? No. why not? Frankly Id rather not say. Oh you wouldnt. Its a personal matter. Youre going to have to do better than that. Do the words complete pandemonium strike terror in your heart?
11/04/87
So your teacher didnt know youd ripped your pants and she made you do a problem at the chalkboard? That sums it up. How awful! What did you do?? I didnt have a choice. I mooned the whole class. Thats why youre home early? Three teachers and the principal couldnt restore order.
12/04/87
During emergency landing replace dinner tray and bring seat to upright position. Extinguish all smoking materials. Including spacecraft if possible. Out of fuel the courageous Spaceman Spiff is forced to land on the distant planet Zok! The valiant explorer surveys the Zokkian landscape who knows what dangers lie hidden in the cratered terrain? Undaunted Spiff sets out to find help! Miles later it is evident the planet is completely uninhabited! Our hero is marooned on a lifeless planet! Alone on an alien world. Alone ... all alone ... Darn it why doesnt anyone ever tell me when the lunch bell rings?
13/04/87
Susie wheres Miss Wormwood? Whos that lady at her desk? Miss Wormwoods sick. Thats our substitute teacher. A substitute? Lets see your teaching certificate lady!
14/04/87
Good morning class. Ill be your substitute teacher today. Miss Wormwood left me instructions as to what we need to go over so we shouldnt have any problems. Oh wait heres a note she added. Just a second. Ok which one of you is Calvin? Not me!
15/04/87
We had a substitute teacher in school today. Did you like her? she was ok I guess. You guess? Its hard to say. She went home at noon.
16/04/87
Mr. Jones lives 50 miles away from you. You both leave home at 5:00 and drive toward each other. Mr. Jones travels at 35 mph and you drive at 40 mph. At what time will you pass Mr. Jones on the road? Given the traffic around here at 5:00 who knows? I always catch these trick questions.
17/04/87
Ive got a scheme to get us some money. Oh boy. See? I sneaked all these kernels of corn off my dinner plate tonight. How is that going to get us money? Easy. I just stick them under my pillow. With any luck the tooth fairy wont know theyre fakes until its too late!
18/04/87
Dad how do people make babies? Most people just go to Sears buy the kit and follow the assembly instructions. I came from Sears?? No you were a blue light special at Kmart almost as good and a lot cheaper. Aauughhh! Dear what are you telling Calvin now?!
19/04/87
How come you dont put on any pajamas? Fact is I never take them off! Did you ash your face and brush your teeth? Yep! We both did! Ok then good night. Good night. Move over will ya? Im already over! You should be over there! Quit pushing fuzz-for-brains! Youre on my side! Call me names will you?! Yeah! Whumpp! Yaaaaa! Oh no! Ok! Ok! You win! Phoo ... I wish you had brushed your teeth! Yecch ... I wish you had washed your face!
20/04/87
Ive got to give a 5-minute oral report in school on Thursday. Were supposed to research our subject write it up and present it to the class with a visual aid. Thats a big assignment. Ill say. I hate my teacher. She knows well all do it on the last evening but she gave us three days to worry about it.
21/04/87
Whats the subject of your report? The brain. What do you know about brains? Well I saw this movie where they kept this guys brain alive in a tank of water. Then a power surge mutated the brain and it crawled out and terrorized the populace. Thats informative. Unfortunately for my report Mom caught me and I didnt get to see how it ended.
22/04/87
Ive got to give my report on The Brain at school today. See my visual aid? I cooked some noodles and put them in a paper bag. Doesnt that look like brains? Well I guess Im all set. Did you write your report yet? Nah. I borrowed Moms pocket dictionary. Ill do it on the bus.
23/04/87
My five-minute report on The Brain. Of course its difficult to explain the complexities of the brain in just five minutes but to begin the brain is part of the central nervous system. Ill pause for a few moments so you can all finish writing that down. Calvin!
24/04/87
Pow! Jab! Kick! Pow! Pow! Rattatattattatta rattatattatta eeeeeeeeeee boom! Please please pretty please? No. you shouldve save some of your own Halloween candy.
25/04/87
Hey can we change the channel now? I want to watch something else. My shows not over yet. Aw cmon! you see this program all the time! Cant we watch my show for once? No I was here first. Pipe down this is a good part. I hate national geographic animal specials.
26/04/87
Good night Calvin. ... all right where are you?! Calvin I thought I said to get ready for bed! Now hurry up! I cant! Im trapped in slow motion! Well youd better get in normal speed ... now! Ahh! Time snap!
27/04/87
Point A is twice as far from point C as point B is from A. if the distance from point B to point C is 5 inches how far is point A from point C? The living dead dont need to solve word problems.
28/04/87
Calvin the zombie searches for food. Horribly the undead feed upon the living! ... although in a pinch a pbj will do I fyou eat it messily enough.
29/04/87
When in Rome ...
30/04/87
Gkpthh! Heh heh ... thpkk! Hee hee. Hee hee ha ha ha ho ho hee hee hoo hoo ha ha ho heh heh ... of course. Real zombies never get the giggles by looking at each other.
01/05/87
Oh no! Too much bubble bath! Uh oh! Pop! How on earth do you do this?!? These things seem to happen.
02/05/87
Aauughhhhh

Im fl-ooof! Ow! Ack! Ooh! Are you ok? Boy you were almost up there. I know! (ow) We just need a little more wind. Ok heres another breeze! Let er rip! Oomph! Yow! Maybe youre too heavy. Gee I hadnt thought of that. Hmm ... how can I get lighter? Mrs. Carroll says a naked kid tied to a stuffed animal is running through her yard. You handle it I got the little nudist out of her bird bath remember?
04/05/87
Were supposed to have this whole stupid book read by tomorrow. Flip-ip-ip-ip-ip-ip! There! Its good to get that out of the way! Reading goes faster if you dont sweat comprehension. Wheres the Frisbee?
05/05/87
Ahoy! Toss the rope ladder down! Whats the password? Tigers are mean! Tigers are fierce! Tigers have teeth and claws that pierce! Tigers are great! They cant be beat! If I was a tiger that would be neat! He can climb the tree without the ladder so he got to make up the password. Go on whats the third verse?
06/05/87
Mom when are you going shopping next? I dont know why? We seem to be out of gun powder. Sheesh I didnt even do it yet.
07/05/87
Now! Are you sure theres a career to be made as a human discus? Well we gotta get a bigger field.
08/05/87
I tripped a kid yesterday and he fell in the mud it was hilarious. Aaugh! Ploop! I dunno. That kind of humor is so broad. You didnt do it right. Cmere and give me a hand.
09/05/87
Whats this? It looks gross. Its a vegetarian meal. Its good for you. Vegetarian?? Yecchh! Im not a vegetarian! Im a dessertarian.
10/05/87
Ever notice how different the air smells after a good rain? It smells like ... like ... dead worms! Wow! Look at the size of that puddle! Wahoooo! Ha ha ha ha ha! Sploosh splash sploosh splash! Hee hee hee hee! Ha ha ha ha! Rats my underwears all soaked. Now its gonna itch and ride up my rear all afternoon. Well it was worth it! Thats why I never wear the stuff.
11/05/87
I cant get this stupid hair to comb right. See how it sticks out in back? Maybe you need a haircut. Yeah but barbers never cut it the way I want. Boy what a great idea! Thanks! This is easy! You really think your Mom will pay me eight bucks?
12/05/87
So exactly how would you like the back cut? Just trim the part that sticks out and taper it a little. Wouldnt you rather have it real short? No just cut a little bit. Are you sure? Dont you think it should be real short? It looks like it should be real short. Are you trying to tell me something? No I just think it should be real short. Especially oh right here.
13/05/87
You made a mistake didnt you? No I can cover it up. Cover what up? What did you do wrong? Nothing I cant help it if your head has a funny bumps that make the scissors go screwy. Your heads gonna have funny bumps in a minute if you dont tell me what you did!! Oops. Hold still. Whyd you say oops?! whatd you do now?! Nothing. Lets try parting your hair from ear to ear.
14/05/87
This haircut had better look good fuzz brain. Youll love it. Its kind of new wave. New wave? Like how? Well sort of punk actually. Like a mohawk? In some places its sort of like a mohawk. I want a mirror. You know whats the rage this year? ... hats.
15/05/87
Look what you did to my hair! It looks like it was cut with a weed-eater! Nothing a little tonic and combing cant fix. Get away from me you menace! If Mom sees this shell blow her blood vessels! What am I going to do?? Hows that? Sort of the Lawrence of Arabia look! Sort of the Lobotomy Patient look.
16/05/87
My cigarette smoke mixed with the smoke of my .38. If business was as good as my aim Id be on easy street. Instead Ive got an office on 49th street and a nasty relationship with a string of collection agents. Yeah thats me. Tracer Bullet. Ive got eight slugs in me. Ones lead and the rest are bourbon. The drink packs a wallop and I pack a revolver. Im a private eye. Suddenly my door swung open and in walked trouble. Brunette as usual. Take your hat off at the dinner table Calvin. Its not polite. She was a pushy dame. But she had a case.
17/05/87
This is supposed to be great art. ... so why does it look like a bunch of decapitated naked people? A strange feeling comes over Calvin in the art museum. His parents engrossed in culture remain blissfully unaware of Calvins terrible transformation! Yes a tyrannosaurus is loose in the art museum! The curator shrieks and pandemonium ensues! A guard reaches for his pistol but the dinosaur is upon him and he is messily devoured! The giant lizards glory is captured forever on film by the anti-theft cameras! Patrons of the arts flee for their lives! Hundreds of priceless paintings are ripped to shreds in the awful rampage! Wealthy benefactors are trampled! The museum is in ruins! On to symphony hall!! Calvin? Calvin? Were in the next room now. Cmon. I think wed better get him out o fhere. He had that grin again. I wanna see dinosaurs at the natural history museum again. We spent all afternoon there Calvin.
18/05/87
Take your hat off at the dinner table Calvin. Here comes the hurricane. You cut your hair!! No I didnt Hobbes did. Why on earth did you cut your own hair?! Look at you! I said Hobbes cut it! You think Id do this?? Well I didnt!
19/05/87
Some barber you are! Mom says theres nothing I can do but wait for my hair to grow back. In the meantime Ive got to go around looking like Ive got mange! I hope youre happy. Happy?! You stiffed me! Wheres my eight bucks?!
20/05/87
Look Im sorry I gave you a bad haircut. I didnt mean to. A fat lot of good that does me. I can make it up to you. Honest. Yeah? How? I bought a yellow magic marker. See Ill just draw some hair on there its looking better already. Really? Is it?
21/05/87
Well your hair doesnt stick up the way it used to but at least your heads yellow again. Thanks Hobbes. youre a real life saver. Im sorry I got so mad at you. Nonsense. No harm done. Boy wait till I show Mom! Uh oh. Does it come off? From now on just keep your brainy ideas to yourself ok?
22/05/87
Calvin. Calvin the Genius. Calvin the Super Genius. This is how you sign your reports? It kind of inclines you to read it more charitably dont you think?
23/05/87
Clink. Clink. My iced tea is a failure.
24/05/87
Whew! This must be the biggest hill in the state! Kind of frustrating isnt it? I wish Dad would get transferred to the Andes. Lets go down the hill and see if we can travel into the future. Go into the future? How? Its easy! All we have to do is get going real fast and well time-warp! Ha ha! Faster! Faster! Gosh what do you suppose the future will be like? Who knows? Flying cars and cities built built on clouds maybe! Just think of all the weird things we can tell people we saw! Oh boy! Hey were at the bottom of the hill. I didnt feel any time warp did you? Nope. But look! Its two minutes later than when we started! Were in the future!! Hmm ... things havent improved. Im disappointed.
25/05/87
Goodness youre filthy. Into the tub with you. I obey the letter of the law if not the spirit. Lets hear some water running! Nuts.
26/05/87
Im home! Yaaaaa! Aaaugh! Yowp! Arrgh! Yip! (pant pant) Why do you always do that?! Natural exuberance is one of those qualities that makes us tigers so darn endearing!

28/05/87

Im home. Im home. Im home! Wellll? So youre home.
30/05/87
Calvin steps up to the plate and the outfield heads for the bleachers. Its sure to be another homer folks. Heres the pitch! Bonk! Not surprisingly the pitcher decides to walk Calvin.
31/05/87
Before beginning any home plumbing repair make sure you possess the proper tools for the job. Check the following list of handy explitives and see that you know how to use them. Calvin wakes up one morning to find he no longer exists in the third dimension! He is in 2-D! Thinner than a sheet of paper Calvin has no surface area on the bottom of his feet! He is immobile! Only by waving his body can Calvin create enough friction with the ground to move! Having width but no thickness Calvin is vulnerable to the slightest gust of wind! To avoid drafts he twists himself into a tube and rolls across the floor! Someone is coming! Calvin quickly stands up straight. Turning perfectly sideways he is nearly invisible vertical line! No one will notice! Hey Dad know why you didnt see me all morning?? I was two-dimensional! Hmmm Ill bet you cant do it all afternoon too ... dear!
01/06/87
I couldnt read it because my parents forgot to pay the gravity bill.
02/06/87
Make a prediction Hobbes. what for? So we can see if you have ESP. Ok I predict youll find an irresistible attraction to a mud hole. Ha ha. You stay away from me. Its going to come true! I can feel it!
03/06/87
Hey Dad how does a carburetor work? I cant tell you. Why not? Its a secret. No it isnt! you just dont know!
04/06/87
This is a job for ... aackk! Waaughhh!! For? ... someone else.
05/06/87
Time for bed Calvin. Its a free country. I can do what I want. Good night. Communists!
06/06/87
Oh no I have to go to the bathroom! The monsters will get me as soon as I set foot on the floor! I know! Put your pillow down as a decoy. While theyre eating that you can slip out! Great idea! Im coming out of bed now! Im coming out of bed now! Here I am all fat and squishy! They took it! Man look at those feathers fly! Youd better hurry! No Ive decided to stay here and wet the bed. But its ok with me if you dont want to stay.
07/06/87
Croquet is a gentlemans game. Thats hard to believe. Ive played before and I can tell you the temptation to misuse these things is awful. Hey dont put the wickets so far apart. This is the way theyre supposed to be. No it isnt you big cheater. Youre doing this because you can hit the ball harder than I can. Cheater?? Who took the lucky red ball when I wasnt looking? I got to pick first because you did last time! Thats a lie! You always take the lucky red ball first! Call me a liar. Will you? Well youre just a poop head! So there! Thbpbpthpt! Potty mouth! Potty mouth! Calvin is a potty mouth! Youre asking for a toothless mouth buster! Yeah? Says you and what army? You couldnt knock the teeth out of a mosquito! Ha! Mosquitos dont even have teeth. That shows how dumb you are! Compared to you Im Einstein! Leggo my leg! Ow! Go stick your nose in a rubber hose you walking flea condo! Id say it takes one to know one bozo! Why dont you go play in the food processor! Its getting dark Calvin. Cmon inside! Aw Mom were right in the middle of a croquet game!
08/06/87
Bombarded by high-energy photons Calvin is transformed into a living x-ray. Although this condition will facilitate future medical diagnoses it does make Calvins presence at the dinner table a disgusting ordeal! Everyone can see Calvins food being ground input mushy pulp and swallowed! At this moment Calvin chews up a large spoonful of creamed corn! For gosh sakes close your mouth when you chew!! You think we want to see that?! Mkghh! Smack! Blaghkh!
09/06/87
Heres a little town. Heres a steam shovel scooping out a giant hole. Here comes the bulldozer pushing thousands of barrels of toxic nuclear waste into the giant hole. Over the years these dangerous poisons seep into underground waterways. The cancer rate of the nearby little town triples. If you want me Ill be under the bed.
10/06/87
A strike?? That pitch was four feet above my head! Ha! It was a perfect pitch! Youre just too short! Yeah? Well youre just too stupid! Kick kick kick. Well youre just too ugly. Kick. Kick. Kick. Kicking dust is the only part of this game we really like.
11/06/87
Want to know a funny trick? When somebody isnt looking you tie his shoes together! Ha ha! Thats great! Lets go find some sucker to pull it on! Yeah! Clunk! Well. Well! Woo hoo hoo hoo.
12/06/87
Im hungry. Can I have a snack? Sure. Help yourself. You can have an apple or an orange from the fridge. Even through were both talking english were not speaking the same language.
13/06/87
Boy I love summer vacation. I can feel my brain beginning to atrophy already. Shhh ...
14/06/87
Im going outside Mom! Hold all my calls. Calvin looks around something is different. The odd-colored tree behind him slowly lifts up! Its not a tree at all! Its a let! Oh no! Calvin is the size of a bug to a bug he runs for his life! A claw crashes with deafening impact! The bug is trying to step on Calvin! What a horrible fate! Calvin scrambles madly promising himself that hell never squish another bug if he lives to return to normal size! Suddenly in a spray of slime the bug is gone! A monstrous frog licks its chops! Calvin is saved! Aacck! Whats that on my plate?! Good heavens get it off the table!! But Mom frogs are our friends!
15/06/87
Look Hobbes I got a magic carpet! Whats so magic about it? Magic carpets fly! You can ride them! Isnt this the rug from the hallway? Up rug! Up! Up! Hey look! It works! Ok rug warp factor five! Is this legal? Do you have your registration and proof of insurance?
16/06/87
Wow! Ive never been on a magic carpet before. Hmm ... me either. Ok rug lets cruise at 10000 feet! Wheeeee! Gosh this sure beats having Mom drive us around! Lets go to the mall and hang out! Do we get complimentary bags of nuts on our flight?
17/06/87
Hey lets fly into the city and buzz Dads office! Ha! Wont be be surprised when he sees us out his 20th floor window! What if hes mad that we took the hallway rug? Whats to get mad about? We wiped our feet first. Yeah but all this city mileage may hurt the resale value.
18/06/87
Ok I think thats Dads building up ahead. Im not sure where his office is so well just have to look in the windows as we zip by. Hey! There he is! Theres Dad! Hi Dad! Dad look! Out the window! Darn it! Hes still reading that brief. Look out the window Dad! Did you bring any rocks? I didnt think to.
19/06/87
Hey Dad! Look out the window! I cant believe hes just sitting in there. Why doesnt he look up? I guess hes pretty busy. Yeah but we cant sit up here all day! Sheesh. Lets go. If he had noticed us we couldve given him a ride home. Hmph. I say let him take the smelly ol bus if he cant even look out the window once in a while serves him right.
20/06/87
Im home! Dad! Hobbes and I flew by your office window today on a rug! We saw you working. We waved and hollered but you didnt even look up. We couldnt believe it. You missed the whole thing! I thought we were cutting down his sugar intake.
21/06/87
Oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy. Wait! Wait! Ive got to savor this moment! The brilliance of it all! Im a genius! A sheer genius! Susies playing on the sidewalk! Nows my chance to use the snowball Ive been saving in the freezer! Shell never expect a snowball in June! Boy will she be mad! Ha ha ha! This is going to be great! Here it comes! Oh boy! Oh boy! Hey Susie!! Piff. I missed! Darn it! Darn it! Darn it! Of all the miserable luck! Aaarrghh! There mustve been a cross breeze! I cant believe it! I save that snowball for three whole months! I ... scoop scoop. I ... I ... uh ... pow! The irony o fthis is just sickening.
22/06/87
1988 isnt too far away Dad. If your thinking of running for Dad again youd better get your campaign in gear. Frankly the pools look grim. I dont think youve got much of a shot at keeping the office. I take comfort in the fact that not many people want it. Flippant remarks have a way of haunting candidates you know.
23/06/87
The chameleon sits motionless. Amazingly the lizard changes color to blend in with his surroundings. Moments later he is virtually invisible. I see you hiding back there! Now come clean up this mess you made in the kitchen!
24/06/87
Hold still. Theres a monster horsefly on your head. Pow! Can you believe it? I missed! So excuse me for trying to help! you wanna scratch a stinging welt all day? Fine! Go away! No wait theres a mosquito on you.
25/06/87
I wanna horsey ride! Im busy Calvin. You know Dad it wont be long before Im all grown up. One day youll wake up and wonder how all the years slipped by. Youll look back and say Where has the time gone? Calvins so big. Its hard to remember when he was small enough that I could give him horsey rides. ... but those days will be lost forever. I think Ive worked through my potential guilt now. No no! Jump the fence!
26/06/87
I read that girls are made up of sugar and spice and everything nice ... whereas boys are made of snips and snails and puppy dogs tails. Hmph. So what are tigers made of? Dragonflies and katykids but mostly chewed-up little kids. Oh thats clever.
27/06/87
Do you have any money? Nope. Hmm ... how can we get some? Who do we know that we could sue?
28/06/87
Whats wrong with you fish? Why wont you eat this big fat juicy worm? Besides the obvious I mean. Boy I hate fishing this is so boring! Look I can see a whole bunch of fish down there but theyre not biting! Lousy fish! By golly Im not going to sit here all day waiting for them to get hungry! Here help me carry this rock. Well dump it in the water and blast the fish out. Then we can just pick them up. Heave! Kabloosh! Ok it was a bad idea! But I got wet too right? No no your idea was fine! We just didnt throw in a big enough object.
29/06/87
... so could I Mom? Please? Pleeeaase? I still dont think giving her Bambi eyes is going to get you a flame thrower. Maybe I should sniffle a little too huh?
30/06/87
What a perfect day! If something doesnt happen here soon Im gonna wack out.
01/07/87
Look a firefly! Your rear hasnt lit if thats what youre wondering. I cant even tell what muscle to flex.
02/07/87
Hey Hobbes want to see an antelope? An antelope?! Cmon! See shes coming down the ladder to her boyfriends car! Youre not laughing. Its not funny.
03/07/87
Tomorrow is independence day. The Declaration of Independence says everyone is created equal and is entitled to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Oh. So when does Paul Revere ride through town and give us our presents.
04/07/87
Bang! Kapwinngg! Up up and awaaayy!
05/07/87
The dreaded scum beings fire! Spaceman Spiff is hit! It never fails. I just washed and waxed this thing. Our hero the intrepid Spaceman Spiff struggles with the controls of his damaged spacecraft! The freem propulsion blasters are useless! Spiff crashes onto the surface of an alien planet! Unscathed the fearless space explorer emerges from the smoldering wreckage! He is marooned on a hostile world! Scorched by twin suns the planet is nothing but barren rock and methane! Theres no hope of finding food or water. Spiff collapses! Oh no. a hideous alien spots him! In his weakened state Spiff is no match for the monster! This could be the end!! Lunchtime! I brought you a sandwich and some lemonade. Bring the dishes back when youre done ok? ... oh well. Thanks Mom.
06/07/87
Z. Z. Z. Tag! The games over tuna brain.
07/07/87
Somebody told me rotten eggs smell bad. They smell terrible. Put em back Calvin.
08/07/87
I want 8 cookies to go please. This is not a drive-thru! Put that back in the garage!
09/07/87
Quick Mom! Aliens just landed in the back yard! They demand to talk to you! You go on out! Ill guard the cookies in the kitchen! Quick! Hurry! Shes not buying this. Calvin just how dumb do you think I am?
10/07/87
What do you think is the secret to happiness? Is it money power or fame? Id choose money. If you have enough money you can buy power and fame that way youd have it all and be really happy! Happiness is being famous for your financial ability to indulge in every kind of excess. I suppose thats one way to define it. The part I think Id like best is crushing people who get in my way.
11/07/87
Look! Somebody poured new cement! Is anyone looking? We could write our initials in it or make a hand print or something! Yeah! Or something! I think wed better find a hose quick! I didnt think it would set up so fast.
12/07/87
Psst. Hey kid cmere under the bed. Ive got a brand new toy for you. Uh oh. I think I saw a tentacle under the bed! Monsters! Turn on the lights! That makes monsters shrivel up. Good idea. Click! Aarrghhh! Aieeee. Aahhhhhh!! Gackk! Ha ha. We got em! Just the ones under the bed wed better open up the drawers and closet too and get some light in those places! By golly no monsters going to get us tonight! Wither and die bloodsucking freaks of nature!! Why is your light on? What in the world are you doing?!? Monsters Dad. They could be anywhere. Youre trashing your room at 1:00 in the morning looking for monsters?! If you dont get in bed this instant youll have lot more to worry about than stupid monsters!! What we need is some way to shrivel him up.
13/07/87
Hey Calvin whatcha doin? Quiet down or youll give away my position. Hobbes and I are having a water fight. A water fight! Can I play? You? Ha! War is a manly art! I suppose anything so idiotic would have to be. Can I play in your game or not? I dont know it seems youd rather be making smart remarks.
14/07/87
Cmon cant I join your water fight? I have my own water pistol and everything! Itll just take me a minute to get it. Ok you can play but Hobbes is on my team. You have to fight both of us. Great! I can beat you and your stuffed tiger any day. Ill go put on my swimsuit. Susies going to play with us ok? Oh boy. Girls flip for guys in jams.
15/07/87
I got my water pistol! Im all set! Good. Now Hobbes and I will be one team and you ... Look at your toy tiger! Hes wearing jams!! Thats so cute! Let me squeeze him! Oh for petes sake knock it iff! You go around the house and count to fifty and then we begin all right? You and your dumb jams. This is war remember?! Youre just jealous. ... ooh what a babe!
16/07/87
Listen up yogurt brain. Heres our strategy: Ill go around the house this way and you go around the other way. Ill draw Susies fire and you can let her have it from behind with your water balloon! Got it? Ok lets go! Thanks for the water balloon Hobbes youre a great double agent!
17/07/87
Ha ha! Ambush!! Have a drink Susie! Whoa! Whoop! Youve got Hobbes water balloon! Where did? How? Uh oh. Bloosh! I promise you youll hang for this traitor! Im easily wiled by a woman in a swimsuit.
18/07/87
My best friend betrays me! Susie drenched me with my own teammates water balloon! Some buddy you are you Benedict Arnold! Hmph Id do it again in a minute. Susie likes my jams. Dont even talk to me! You and I are through! Ha! Promises promises! Um ... I take it the game is over. Get this traitor off me. He cheats when he fights too.
19/07/87
Can you believe this? Some idiot tossed garbage here in this beautiful spot. Ill bet future civilizations find out more about us than wed like them to know. Look another can thrown on the ground! Boy this makes me mad! By golly if people arent burying toxic wastes or testing nuclear weapons theyre throwing trash everywhere! Youd think planets like this were a dime a dozen! Now Ive got to carry this gross thing. You know there are times when its a source of personal pride to not be human. Im with you.
20/07/87
Arent these long summer days great? No responsibilities at all! We have the whole day to ourselves. Dont you wish it could be like this all year forever? No school. No job no anything? Yeah. Just gloat about it why dont you!!
21/07/87
Hey Dad what are clouds made of? Hmm ... I used to know that. I think theyre mostly water. So how come they float? Well its sort of evaporated water maybe there are some other gases too. Im not sure. So why are they white when the rest of the sky is blue? Heck beats me. I guess we ought to look this stuff up. I take it theres no qualifying exam to be a Dad.
22/07/87
One of the best things about summer is going to sleep with the fan on. The gentle breeze blowing droning hum everything seems safe and serene when the fan is on. Its cool and lulling and perfect for sleep. It almost lets one forget he has a heavy fur coat for a bunkmate. If you dont like it theres plenty of room on the floor buster.
23/07/87
Hey Mom whats this I hear about the greenhouse effect? They say the pollutants we dump in the air are trapping in the suns heat and its going to melt the polar ice caps! Sure youll be gone when it happens but I wont! nice planet youre leaving me! This from the kid who wants to be chauffeured any place more than a block away. Hey nobody told me about the ice caps all right?
24/07/87
More bad news on your polls Dad. Were looking at an all-time low in popularity here. Well Calvin. Thats certainly food for thought. Now heres something you can think about. The average cost of raising a kid to age 18 is $100000. Thats a lot of money. So the question you should be asking yourself is Is that hundred grand a gift or a loan? Gotcha Dad. I was just on my way to bed.
25/07/87
Ring ring. Hello? May I speak with your father please? Hec you dont need my permission! Be my guest! What a weirdo. Ring ring.
26/07/87
Thats it you climb up and then help me up! Tigers are natural-born tree climbers. Of course we usually have grappling hooks ropes and utility belts. Hey heres a great tree for climbing! Let me get on your shoulders so I can reach the first branch ok? Geez how many bricks do you have in your pockets?! Whoa! Hold steady you weakling. Ive almost got it! Move up move up! Hurry and grab it before my spine telescopes. Got it! Hey dont let go! Hold me up! Forget it! You can support your own weight bowling ball butt. Mmph! Mmph! I cant get up! Give me a boost! Hey! What are you doing?! Dont take off my shoes! Are you nuts? Hey stop! Aack! Oh no! dont tickle! Pbth! Eek! Hee hee ha ha! Stop it! I cant hold on! Hee hee hoo hoo! Aaugh! Nice landing. Im probably paralyzed. All except your mouth obviously. Im not sorry at all. Give me back my shoes. No.
27/07/87
I cant believe how dull my life is. Its so boring here. Nothing ever changes around here. Nothing ever happens. It seems as if (hang on) everybody but me gets to have an exciting life. Actually Id like less excitement in my life. Why? Are you doing fun things when Im not around?? Huh? Are you?!
28/07/87
Whats wrong Calvin? Why are you still in bed? I dont feel good. Your forehead seems warm. Wed better take your temperature. I cant be sick now! Its still summer vacation! Theres no school to stay home from! This is my time! Somebody owes me big for this!!
29/07/87
Hi there Calvin. I understand youre not feeling well. Me? Im fine! I just sit around torture chambers in my underwear for kicks. Lets see your degree you quack! Im not going to hurt you. Im just going to examine you to see whats wrong. Ill tell you whats wrong! Ive got Dr. Frankenstein for a pediatrician thats whats wrong! Nurse call the anesthesiologist in here will you please? My Dads a lawyer Ill have you know! Dont come near me!
30/07/87
Deep in a dank dungeon on the dismal planet Zog the fearless Spaceman Spiff is held prisoner by the sinister Zog king. A guard leads Spiff to the interrogation room. Our hero is stoic and defiant! At last I meet the famed Spaceman Spiff! I trust you are ... heh ... heh ... enjoying your visit? Youre wasting your time maggot from mars! Ill never give in! Never you hear me?! Never! Kid dont make me recant the Hippocratic oath ok?
31/07/87
Well you certainly were a terror in the doctors office. I fended him off with his own tongue depressor. Thats why I didnt get a shot. You didnt need a shot. Your behavior was inexcusable. All that counts is that he couldnt get near enough to stick me. He thinks Im a little pink pin cushion in underpants. Someday I hope you have a kid that puts you through what Ive gone through. Yeah Grandma says thats what she used to tell you.
01/08/87
Here is a proud city. Full of happy prosperous citizens. They go on about their business unaware that the moon mysteriously moved a few miles closer to the earth. Unaware that is until the tide comes in. Sploosh! Gisshhh!
02/08/87
The fires not lighting huh? Can I make a suggestion? Give up on that sissy lighter fluid. Cant we cook the hamburgers yet? The coals arent hot enough. But Im hungry I want to eat now! Well youll just have to wait. You know Calvin sometimes the anticipation of something is more fun than the thing itself once you get it. Here we are its a beautiful evening. Its nice to just sit here and look at the trees while we wait for the coals to get hot dont you think? Dinner will be over soon and afterward well be distracted with other things to do. But now we have a few minutes to ourselves to enjoy the evening. These summer days go by so quickly. Its good that every now and then we have to wait for something. So should I go to McDonalds then or what? Yeah I know you think you are going to be six all of your life.
03/08/87
(NO TEXT) - cowboy and indian
04/08/87
What a perfect day! Isnt it great to be on summer vacation? To be able to enjoy all this with no school and no responsibilities? ... ahhhhhhh ... I cant believe theres nothing on TV but repeats.
05/08/87
I think a bee landed on my back! Can you see it? I dont want to move. Thats not a bee. It isnt? Whew. No thats a hornet if I ever saw one! Ow!
06/08/87
If you could have three wishes granted what would they be? Just three wishes huh? Hmm. That would be a tough decision. I guess Id have to think about it a while. Oops! Hang on. Ok. I know what my first wish would be.
07/08/87
One of natures uglier creatures the bat is a misunderstood marvel of evolution. Producing a series of loud high-pitched squeaks the bat can judge an insects distance and elevation by the time delay of the squeaks echo! Changes in the echos pitch reveal the doomed bugs direction! No movement escapes the incredible senses of the bat! Glump! Ta-daa! Eyes closed! Calvin sit up and eat with a fork like a civilized human being.
08/08/87
Yawn. Waauughh! For the last time get out of bed! Were going to be late. Im trying. Im trying.
09/08/87
That run doesnt count! You didnt touch third base! Thats cause third base crawled to the outfield! Wap! Ha ha! Easy out! Hey! Where are you going?! You have to stay on the base line you cheater! Yeah? Prove it! This isnt fair! You cant run anywhere! Just watch me! If we had a first baseman youdve been out a long time ago! But we dont do we? Gotcha! Youre out! Ok Im up to bat again! What fun! Two man baseball is a real sport! A real sport for idiots. Next time Im going to tag you out with the bat instead of the ball.
10/08/87
Hobbes did you hear? Mom and Dad are taking us camping! We get to live in a tent and go fishing and canoeing! Wont that be fun? Well be roughing it! Living off the land! No TV or radio or ... uh-oh. Whats wrong? This sounds suspiciously like one of Dads plots to build my character.
11/08/87
Gosh this is going to be a fun vacation! Camping out! Wow! I cant wait to get there! A whole week hiking and canoeing and swimming and fishing! A whole week without a single newspaper or a decent cup of real coffee. Doesnt Mom like camping? Mom was up a little too late packing.
12/08/87
See that island ahead? Thats where were camping! Oh boy! Ahh this is the life! Fresh air clean water lots of exercise and ... boom! Dear youre back-paddling. Were turning around and finding a hotel!
13/08/87
Whens this rain going to let up? I dont know Calvin. Hey cheer up gang! I packed storm gear. Always be prepared. You know. These ponchos are super. Theyre thermal-sealed lightweight nylon laminated with flexible urethane for complete water protection! Yeah Dad its great that we wont get wetter than we already are. Zinc oxide thongs tanning lotion ... wrong duffel bag. Lets see which one of these was it?
14/08/87
Im glad Dad finally got the tents up. Now I can get out of these soggy clothes. Too bad you cant put on dry clothes. Youd feel a lot better. Hey wait! No! Dont do that here! Ackpth!
15/08/87
Some trooper you are! Whats a little rain? This is what being in the wilderness is all about! Ha ha! At least its not snowing right? Right? I mean say it was snowing so hard we couldnt make a fire. Boy I love cold canned ravioli.
16/08/87
Tum de ta ta dee dee do. Boy this sure beats sitting in an office all day! Is it still raining? Of course its still raining. Its been raining for days. Why should it stop now?! Were going to need a vacation after this vacation. Ill say! We cant even keep a fire going. I cant believe dad went out to catch fish. In this weather? Hes a fanatic! Either that or were al out of packaged food. Well probably starve to death on this god-forsaken rock. After all that spam starving doesnt sound so bad. If we live to get home Im never going to set foot outside again as long as I live. What a lucky kid Calvin is! I never got to do this stuff when I was his age. Hey Calvin! Want to learn how to gut a fish?
17/08/87
Hows the water? Freezing. Im coming out. Hand me my towel. Ok? Wring wring. This is the dumbest vacation Ive ever been on.
18/08/87
It has been very buggy week has it? Youre really reaching Dad.
19/08/87
Were packing up! Yep. Ive had enough what a rotten week! Wap! Do you know what any of Dads words meant? No but I wrote some of them down so we can look em up when we get home.
20/08/87
Well gang Im sorry the weather wasnt any better this week. I know it wasnt always a lot of fun but we lived through it and we got ot spend some time together and thats whats really important. Anyway I hope youre all not too disappointed. Calvin tell your dad any judge would take this trip as grounds for divorce. Dad Mom says ... All right! All right!
21/08/87
Dad can you get my ball out of the gutter again? This is the third time this afternoon! I though I told you to play out back! Relax Dad. Its just a ball in the gutter its not as if Ive been embezzling money or killing people. Right? Arent you glad Im not stealing and murdering? I always have to help dad establish the proper context.
22/08/87
Cmon Hobbes. Let down the rope ladder. Whats the rest of the password? I think five verses extolling tigers is plenty. You know its me! Let me up! No. ooh why you lousy rotten stinking ... If you call me names you have to start over at the beginning. Verse six: Tigers are nimble and light on their toes my respect for tigers continually grows. Youre not doing the dance.
23/08/87
Ah-choo! Whew. No brains. Ah ah ah ah choo!! The force of the nasal explosion sends Calvin reeling through the stratosphere! With less and less air to resist his momentum he breaks the pull of earths gravity and hurls past the moon! As he passes out of the galaxy Calvin reflects on the wisdom of covering ones mouth when sneezing to deflect the propulsion. Alas it is knowledge gained too late for poor Calvin the human satellite! But wait! Another sneeze is brewing! Calvin turns himself around! The second sneeze rockets him back to earth! Hes saved! Its a miracle! Ah choo! God bless you. Oh he does Mom he does.
24/08/87
The end of summer is always hard on me. Trying to cram all the goofing off Ive been meaning to do.
25/08/87
How come youre still home? Why arent you at work? I took the day off. Say Dad can I have a look at the classified section? As soon as Im through with it. Gosh Dad Id sure like to borrow that section right this minute. Why dont you read the editorials? New dad wated. Frequent traveler preferred. Liberal views on discipline a must ask for Calvin during normal work hours.
26/08/87
I dont wanna take a bath! I hate taking baths! Aaaahhhh! No no no! They can make me do it but they cant make me do it with dignity.
27/08/87
Rats. I cant tell my gum from my silly putty.

(NO TEXT) jump rope stumble
29/08/87
Im never gonna get married are you? Hmm ... I suppose if the right person came along I might. Somebody with green eyes and a nice laugh who I could call pooty pie. Pooty pie?? Or Bitsy Pookums. I think that would affect my stomach a lot more than my heart. Bitsy Pookums. Id say Yes Snoogy Woogy. Shed reply ...
30/08/87
There (pant) see? I ... I tried it. (cough) It almost (wheeze) killed ... me. Encore. Bravo. Im going to run away to Alaska.
31/08/87
Want to go time traveling with me? See I built a time machine. This looks like your transmogrifier. To the inattentive and brainless layman yes but you crawl under the transmogrifier whereas with the time machine you climb in the top. Ahh.
01/09/87
Are we going to travel into the past or into the future? Well I suppose if we went into the past I could ace any upcoming history exams in school. That might be useful. But if we went into the future we could swipe something and pretend to invent it when we got back. We could be rich. The future it is then! Right. Once Im rich I can hire somebody to take all my dumb tests!
02/09/87
ok Hobbes our time machine is all set put on your goggles and well be off to the future! Why do we have to wear goggles? Geez do you think traveling years into the future is like driving down the street?! Weve got to contend with vortexes and light speeds! Anything could go wrong! Of course we need to wear goggles! Gosh I think my goggles are in the bedroom. If Im not back in a couple of minutes you can go without me. Sit down sissy. I already got your goggles.
03/09/87
All ready? Ill just push the button and off we go into the future! Up up and awaayyy! Were approaching light speed Hobbes! Hang on! I have to go to the bathroom. Now?! In hyperspace?! Are you crazy?!
04/09/87
What year in the future are we going to land? Its hard to pinpoint exactly but Id say sometime around the turn of the century. I hope ol earth is still around then. Ive grown fond of it. If not well return to the present and see if Dad will give me my college tuition early in cash.
05/09/87
Hang on! Were coming in! screeechhh! Wow! So this is the future! I kinda pictured more buildings. Maybe we landed in an aboretum.
06/09/87
You know some people never get to walk in a beautiful woods like this. While others of us face the prospect of never doing anything else. Oh hush well find our way home. You dont remember any of this? Nope were sure lost this time. If I had known we werent going to find our way home Id have brought my coloring books. We could be out here for months. Wed better forge for shelter this will be fun! We can be modern Robinson Crusoes living off the land by our wits! We can be rugged explorers! Yeah! Well be free from all the constraints of civilization! Oh boy! Hey isnt that our back yard? Why so it is. I dont care how long youll be gone Im only making you one sandwich. How about rifles then? Do we have any rifles?
07/09/87
Lets have a look around Im sure well run into a robot or something. Look at this. Gosh I wonder what futuristic device this is! Some sort of transportation pod Id guess. I wonder how you get in? I dont see a door or license number anywhere. This is very peculiar. Have you ever seen a tree this color?
08/09/87
I must say the future is quite a bit different than I expected. This breeze is so hot and muggy. I figured theyd be able to control the weather by now. The air stinks too. I guess theres still pollution. Ever feel as if youre being monitored? ... or that youre about to do a double-take?
09/09/87
Aaugh back to the time machine! Run! We mustve gone back in time instead of forward! What tipped you off? The dinosaur?! Dont get smart fuzzbrain. Just get in and face the other direction so we can go into the future this time! You mean we went into the past because we were facing the wrong way!! You think Ive got some triple-a map?! Maybe youd like to steer this time!
10/09/87
We made it! Its a good thing the time machine didnt stall or wed have been eaten by dinosaurs! Were coming back toward the present now. Do you want to stop at home or keep going into the future like we planned? Ive had enough time traveling lets go home. Lets go just a little into the future and see what Im like as a teen-ager! Lets not all right?
11/09/87
Hi Mom. Hobbes and I went time traveling and visited the Jurassic period today. Thats nice. Whats it like? Pretty scary. A dinosaur almost ate us. Actually we were trying to go into the future but we made a mistake. I see well Im glad you made it back. Your mom isnt fazed by much is she? It depends she didnt take the frogs in the toilet so well remember?
12/09/87
Dad look! The suns setting and its only 3 oclock! Its not 3 oclock your watch stopped. Time doesnt stop if your watch stops? Nope. Phooey. For a moment there I thought Id get rich patenting this thing. Id have bought one.
13/09/87
Wipe that grin off your face! Well Hobbes. How do I look? Im doing my best to bite my tongue. I cut out construction paper feathers and taped them on my arms so I can fly! Pretty neat huh? If paper feathers are all it takes to fly dont you think wed have heard about it before? It takes an uncommon mind to think of these things Hobbes. Id agree with that. Heres a gorge. This is a good spot. Youre going to jump off this ledge? Heck no! I need momentum! I want you to toss me over. You understand I assume no responsibility for this? Heave! Im flying. Im flying! Im uh oh. Dont sell the bike shop Orville. Shuh up and go get me some antiseptic.
14/09/87
Mom wants me to clean my room. This is the last straw! I dont have to put up with this totalitarianism! Im seceding! Gee can you secede form your own family? Why not? I never signed up for this group! I wasnt even consulted! The only reason Mom and Dad are my parents is because I was born to them! A biological conspiracy huh?
15/09/87
We can live anywhere we want to now that were seceding from the family! Where do you want to go? The Sahara? Antarctica? How are we going to get to any of those places? We dont even have a car! Ok Dad for this amazing trick Ill need an ordinary American Express card. Now close your eyes ...
16/09/87
Hobbes and I are seceding form this family Mom. Oh really? Yep. Were taking my sled and moving to the Yukon. Well thats a long way away. I know. Heres a list of sandwiches and supplies well need. Why should I do all this if youre seceding from the family? We havent seceded yet! Geez. What kind of mom are you?
17/09/87
Well I guess were all packed. Comic books dart gun space helmet and toboggan! Were off to the Yukon! Do we have a map? Ooh thats right! Glad you remembered! Ill go get one! Dont we have any road maps of the Yukon Mom? I doubt it. Ok heres the Yukon. Now see if you can find the United States. Here they are! Look how close it is! This wont take any time at all!
18/09/87
so long Mom! Were off to the Yukon. Its been nice living here ... but not real nice! Ha ha! Calvin! Wait a minute. Leave it to a mother to drag out a goodbye. Sheesh. Youre going southeast north is that way. Oh yeah. I knew that.
19/09/87
This sled is heavy. I thought we were going to ride it most of the way to the Yukon. Weve only been walking 20 minutes Hobbes. We probably wont get to northern Canada until this afternoon. In that case Im taking a break. Good idea want a comic book? Heres Captain Nitro. I want a sandwich. We just have one apiece. We should save em in case we cant catch a walrus.
20/09/87
You only packed two sandwiches for our entire trip to the Yukon? Relax Hobbes. These sandwiches will give us energy to spare. Mmff. Whath Thith? Honey n marthmallowth? That one is the other has chocolate syrup. As long as were taking a break we might as well record our progress in the log. Journey to the Yukon: Day one. Have traveled for twenty minutes. No snow so far. Food supplies low. Nevertheless morale is high as we push north. My morale would be a lot higher if youd carry the toboggan. Me?! Im the leader of this expedition! Im forging the path! I think its my turn to be leader now. You cant be the leader! See Ive got the commander hat. That can easily be remedied. Hey! Leggo! This is my helmet! Ow quit biting! This is mutiny! Give that back. Im the captain now. I give the commands. First I decree double rations for all officers to aid their decision making capabilities. Oh no you dont! that last sandwich is mine.
21/09/87
Im not going to be led by you! Im the rightful captain! You just stole my captain helmet! Lets say you gave it to me under extreme duress. Ooh if you were littler than me boy Id found you! Ha! Your mom told me you have a weird disease and youre going to get smaller as you grow older! She did not! Thats not true! In fact shes already got a contract from the circus side show. I saw it myself. Im not listening! Im not listening! Ohh say can you see ...
22/09/87
If I cant lead the expedition Im not going at all! You can go to the Yukon yourself. Ha! As captain I fire you anyway! Good! Im going home! You dont have a home. You seceded remember? My life needs a rewind/erase button. ... and a volume control.
23/09/87
What if Mom and Dad wont take me back because I seceded? What if they tell me I cant rejoin the family? They have to take me back! Im their stupid kid right? Right! ... the operative word being stupid.
24/09/87
Gosh maybe Mom and Dad sold all my belongings when I seceded. Maybe they rented out my room. Maybe they moved! ... a lot can happen when you are gone all morning! ... Mommmm!!
25/09/87
Im back Mom. I changed my mind about seceding I want to be your kid again ok? Youll always be my kid. Im glad youre back. Well Hobbes was being a moron. So I decided I didnt want to live in the Yukon with him. So where is Hobbes now? Isnt he back yet? How could Hobbes get back by himself? Youre right that dumb tiger couldnt find his way out of an empty room.
26/09/87
Bedtime Calvin. Wheres Hobbes? I suppose hes wherever you left him. You mean hes still in the woods?? Its night out! What have I told you about leaving your belongings? Hobbes is lost! Ill get a flashlight! Weve got to find him! Hobbes! Hobbes! Calvin its your bedtime! Dont pull this stunt now!
27/09/87
Hobbes you mangy fuzz-brained lunk head where are you?? ... I didnt mean that quite the way the sounded. Cmon Calvin get back inside its too late to go searching for your stuffed tiger now. I cant leave Hobbes alone in the woods at night! Well maybe you should have thought about that before it got dark. This can be a little lesson huh? I thought hed come back by himself. I didnt think hed get lost! Well look for him tomorrow now off to bed with you. Sniff. I hope hes ok. If he hadnt been acting so stupid I would have never left him. I sure wish hed come back. Calvin left Hobbes somewhere in the woods. The poor kids pretty upset. Ill bet. I mean hes really upset. I said Ill bet he is. Really upset. Would my dad have done this? Of course not. I was never spoiled like this ...
28/09/87
No luck? Of course not! How am I going to find a stuffed tiger in the woods at night?! Why cant Calvin keep track of his toys?! I must be crazy to be out here. Hobbes! Oops. Heh heh. I may be crazy but Im not as crazy as you.
29/09/87
Is that you? Did you find Hobbes? Its almost midnight. Yeah I got him. He was out there with the toboggan. Oh honey thank you! Calvin will be so happy!! Mmf. Hed better be or tomorrow Ill leave him in the woods. Cmon well put Hobbes in Calvins bed so hell see him first thing tomorrow. He snuggled up in his sleep! What a little angel! Only at night Im going to bed.
30/09/87
Hobbes! Youre back! Im so glad to see you! Im glad to see you too. Gosh werent you scared being out in the woods at night? Heck no tigers arent scared of that! I got so bored I hiked back. Mom! Look! Hobbes is back! Yes your dad found him last night and brought him in. is that soo?! Mm-hmm. Why dont you go thank him right now?
01/10/87
Hi Calvin. I brought Mr. Bun over so we can play house you and I can be the parents and Hobbes and Mr. Bun can be our children. Oh right. Hobbes and I are gonna put our big plans on hold so we can play house with a stuffed rabbit? Forget it! I dont see why youll play with your dumb ol tiger and not with Mr. Bun and me! Youre just mean thats all! Go play in a microwave Susie. Were busy. Girls are like slugs - they probably serve some purpose but its hard to imagine what. Mr. Bun seems comatose. Did you notice?
02/10/87
Uh oh. It happened again. Calvin wakes up without any recognizable features save two antennae. How disgusting. He oozes out of bed on a trail of slive. Lacking arms and legs how will Calvin put on his clothes? Arent you dressed yet? You are so sluggish in the morning!
03/10/87
Where are you going with the toy telephone? Out in the woods you can come along if youd like. What are you going to do? Try some bird calls.
04/10/87
Eep! Ha ha! Right here kid! Help! Help! The leaf piles got me!! The rake! Gotta get the rake! Forget it kid! Youre doomed! Yaahh! Back you arboreal menace! Back! Wham wham! Sinister fiend! You wont be tricking other innocent little kids! Ill spread you across the whole yard! I though you said you were going to rake the yard today. I did rake the yard. I spent all afternoon ... wheres Calvin?!
05/10/87
Your dad and I are going out to see a movie tonight. Can I come too? No youre staying home. What I got the plague?! Why cant I come? Because other people like watch movies without hearing advice shouted to the characters on the screen. So who does that? Are you saying I do that?
06/10/87
Mom wont let us go to the movie with them so I guess were on our own for tonight. Can we watch TV? What Mom and Dad dont know wont hurt them right? In fact after they leave lets get in the other car and learn to drive! Oh boy! I get to beep the horn ok? Hey theres a teen-ager coming up the drive. Oh no! its Rosalyn! Our bab sitter?! Whats she doing here? Dont Mom and Dad trust us?? Quick hide!!
07/10/87
Were leaving now Rosalyn. Calvin is upstairs. I hope hes not too much trouble tonight. Dont worry I brought a cattle prod this time! Youre mom and dad laughed. Maybe it was a joke. Maybe Mom and Dad think scorching little kids is funny lets go.
08/10/87
Calvin? Are you in there? Cmon out and well make some popcorn. Calvin? Oh brother. I see you Calvin! Cmon back inside. No way lady! If you want us youll have to catch us! Oh geez ... run! Shes wearing cleats! Outta my way! Outta my way!
09/10/87
Lets go! Back in the house! No more monkey business. All right? Phooey. Its my job to watch you and thats what Im going to do even if I have to strap you to a chair. Got it? Jawohl mein fuhrer! Care to repeat that little comment? I said Im not going anywhere. Leggo.
10/10/87
Were home Rosalyn. Was Calvin any trouble? Not too much. I sent him to bed a little while ago. Thats good. Knock knock. Now who could that be at this hour? Police sir. We received a call about two hostages being held here. Calvin! Get down here!
11/10/87
Well if you didnt get in a fight at school what on earth happened to you?! Lets just say sometimes I wish I had a gerbil.
12/10/87
Hi Dad. Im repeating everything anyone says. Oh you are are you? Oh you are are you? Knock it off Calvin. Thats very annoying. Knock it off Calvin. Thats very annoying. I forfeit all my desserts for a week. Ok give them to me. Ha ha. Why dont you go bother your mother for a while?
13/10/87
Psst ... Susie! Whats the answer to question four? Imadoofus. Thanks! The tooth fairys gonna make you rich tonight Susie.
14/10/87
Lets see what you drew for art class Susie. Well a tidy little domestic scene. A house in a yard with flowers. How typically female. Girls think small and are preoccupied with pretty details. But boys think big! Boys think about action and accomplishment! No wonder its men who change the world! Yeah? What did you draw? A squadron of B-1s nuking New York.
15/10/87
Mom can Hobbes and I rent a VCR and a tape tonight? I dont think so Calvin. Its a school night. What if we got an educational tape? Like what? Cannibal stewardess vixens unchained. Now she wont even let us go into the store. I think wed learn a lot by watching that.
16/10/87
Nobody had better be sneaking up on me!! Whump! Its hard to change direction in mid-air. Buddy. Im going to change a lot more than your direction.
17/10/87
Snip. Snap. Crack. Sometimes its good to hush up a while and let autumn stick in a few words.
18/10/87
A dazed Spaceman Spiff crawls from the smoking wreckage of his ship! Our hero now regrets not buying a towing rider on his insurance policy. The courageous Spaceman Spiff has been captured by the hideous Zorgs of Planet X-13! Led through the dank corridors of the dungeon Spiff looks in vain for an opportunity to escape! Our hero is brought before the Zorg despot! So this is the famed space explorer Spiff! Ive waited a long time for this moment earthling scum! You have knowledge we need. Cooperate and well kill you rather painlessly. Lets dispense with the pleasantries you twisted space crustacean. What is it you want from me? A summary of Lewis and Clarks expedition to the Pacific! Ha! Wild Zontars couldnt drag that information out of me! Do your worst! You didnt read the assignment did you Calvin?
19/10/87
Hey Calvin cmere. Shove. Ha ha ha! What a weenie! Ha ha ha! People who get nostalgic about childhood were obviously never children.
20/10/87
You look down in the dumps. I am. Moe keeps knocking me down at school for no reason. Hes mean just for kicks. I sure am glad youre an animal. Animals sometimes make a lot more sense than people do. ... and were cuter too. Right Hobbes good point.
21/10/87
Look Hobbes I need you to come to school with me and show Moe a little fang ok? You dont need to kill him or anything. Just give him something to think about on the way to surgery. He usually comes after me at recess so well get him then. Hey you dont have rabies do you? Certainly not. Rats. Well I suppose hed at least have to get a tetanus shot.
22/10/87
Hey Calvin. Whyd you bring your stuffed tiger to school? Its not a show and tell day. I know. Hobbes is going to give Moe a little treat today: a ride in an ambulance helicopter. Yeah? Hows he going to do that? If you have an aversion to descriptions of carnage you probably dont want to know. Talking with you is sort of the conversational equivalent of an out of the body experience. Dont get to close now. I want Hobbes to stay fresh for this afternoon.
23/10/87
Look Calvins got a teddy bear thats real sweet Calvin. Its a tiger you brainless invertebrate. Hey maybe Id like to play with your teddy! Good idea moe. Hobbes plays kinda rough but hes lots of fun. Cmere and take him. Why? Is the teacher watching? This is a trick right? Im not touching your stupid teddy see? Cmon I dare you! Whats the matter? Are you chicken? Ha ha! Boy! You sure scared him off! You were great! Come back and call me a bear again! Yeah you bub!
24/10/87
I called your teacher about Moes bullying and she said shed put a stop to it. Im afraid you wasted your time Mom. Moe took one look at Hobbes and just about lost his lunch! I dont think Moe will be bothering me for a while. Its not every kid who has a tiger for a best friend. ... and what lucky moms those kids have. Cmon Hobbes if youll lend me a buck Ill buy you a comic book.
25/10/87
I wish it was Saturday instead of Sunday. Any day you have to take a bath and to go to bed early isnt a day off in my book. Autumn Sundays are the worst. You can ever really enjoy Sundays because in the back of your mind you know you have to go to school the next day. And when the leaves change color it just reminds you even more that summers over and schools just begun. Gee I like this season best of all! The trees are like natures own fireworks display! I love the brisk air the early evenings the ... uh ... the ... yes well ... hmm. Kapow! Fwoosh! Zingg! You didnt mention fresh applesauce fuzzhead. Do you like applesauce.
26/10/87
Processed lunch meat is pretty scary. What are those little specks anyway? Lizard parts? Who knows? And this skin. I heard it used to be made of intestine but I think nowadays its plastic. Of course they dye and wax fruit so it looks better. Its like eating a candle. And Mom wonders why Im so hungry after school. Yep wed probably be dead now if it wasnt for Twinkies.
27/10/87
Hey Dad your latest poll just came in. lets see what it says. Be still my heart. Well Ill be! Your popularity is improving! You went up 30 points! Really? Heck no wonder! Im reading the graph upside down. What a klutz I am! ... hope you are all packed Dad. Dont you have some homework to do?
28/10/87
I like to mess with his dreams. Zz ... cookies? For me? Why sure back up the truck.
29/10/87
Buurrp! Good heavens Calvin! What do we say after that? Must be a barge coming through! What do you say?! That sure tasted better going down than coming up! Three strikes and youre history kiddo. Excuse me.
30/10/87
With ultra-sonic hearing Stupendous Man notices a cry of distress from a distant alleyway! He leaps to the edge of the building and prepares to swoop to the rescue! Stupendous Man had not quite realized just how high up he was however. At this altitude the winds were a little tricky and ... Are you going or do you need a push? Dont rush me all right?!
31/10/87
Lurch your way to the car kid. You need a haircut.
01/11/87
Your dads working so try not to bother him ok? Dad I have a question. Yes? Do people ever spontaneously combust? Uh ... not that I know of no. Thats a relief. Thanks Dad. Youre welcome. Pow! Did I fool you? If youre having trouble thinking of ways to make yourself useful. Ill give you some suggestions.
02/11/87
Think its getting any colder out? Not really. I dont think its gonna change. Me either. Nuts. Well lets go in.
03/11/87
Whatcha doing? Counterfeiting money. Its really hard. Look at all the little lines on this bill. Think anyone will fall for your forgery? Sure. Everyone will. Ol George has the gout I see. I said this was hard.
04/11/87
The giant whale swims toward the surface! Its massive tail pumping furiously he gains terrifying momentum! The 35-ton behemoth breaches! He crashes into the surf with deafening impact! Calvin youd better not be splashing the floor you hear me?!
05/11/87
I wont eat any cereal that doesnt turn the milk purple.
06/11/87
The deadly tornado makes its way across the community. The circling updraft clocks at over 200 mph! The twister searches for a trailer park! Finding one it touches down! Debris is thrown for miles in the ensuing explosion of rushing air! When are you going to clean up this room?! It looks like a ... tornado hit it I know.
07/11/87
Oh boy its Saturday!! Whats going on? Why arent there any cartoons on TV? Its just a test pattern. The TV guide says they dont start until 6:30. Heck thats 45 minutes form now! Well cmon. Ill race you up and down the stairs! Why cant he ever get up like this on school days? Go break his little legs will you honey?
08/11/87
Kiss Hobbes good night too Mom. If you dont get a good night kiss you get Kafka dreams. Sleep tight. Dont let the bedbugs bite. Whats that supposed to mean? Do we have vermin in this house?? The mattress is moving! Mom! It must be a bedbug! Gaah! Legs!! It must be huge! How disgusting! Ugghh! Ill run for some bug spray! Dont let him out! I need more weight! Put your foot locker up here! Whats going on up there?! It sounds like hes moving furniture! I got some raid! Lift up the mattress! Let him have it! Gosh all that spray didnt kill him! What are we going to do?! I hear your dad coming! Maybe he can kill it! About time Dad! He crawled back into the bed! Get a fly swatter! Ill (cough) tell you whos going to get swatted! (choke) what have you done to this room?!!
09/11/87
Bad news on your campaign to stay dad Dad. Oh? Yep. The latest poll of six-year-olds in this household shows that they dont care about issues this year. Its character that counts. So why the bad news? Whos the bimbo with you in this old picture? That bimbo is your mother! Whos a bimbo?! Pretty funky hairdo Mom!
10/11/87
Its the sad truth Dad. Nobody cares about your positions on fatherhood. We just want to know about your character. If youre going to be dad here we have to know youve never done or said anything that would reflect poorly on your judgement. I have your college yearbook here. Lets flip through it shall we? Is this you with the keg and the party naked t-shirt. Give me that!
11/11/87
Grandpa says the comics were a lot better years ago when newspapers printed them bigger. He says comics now are just a bunch of Xeroxed talking heads because theres no space to tell a decent story or to show any action. He thinks people should write to their newspapers and complain. Your grandpa takes the funnies pretty seriously. Yeah moms looking into nursing homes.
12/11/87
Did you read this? This TV star made over twenty million dollars last year! What would you do with twenty million bucks? Beats me. I think its ridiculous that anyone makes that kind of money. Ok. Say you only made fifteen million. Lets say eighteen.
13/11/87
Hi Mom. Bum ba da bum bum. Whats cooking. Ha ha ha ha. Whats with you? I thought my life would be seem more interesting with a musical score and laugh track.
14/11/87
I made up a joke. A mans going for a walk so he gets his dog and says heel. ... and the dog looks up and says it takes one to know one buster! ha ha ha. Whats the matter with you? Dont you get it? Ahhh what do tigers know about sophisticated humor anyway? How did the dog learn to talk?
15/11/87
Go way back. Im really gonna belt this. Keep going. Keep going. I said way back! Keep going! That dummy he cant kick it this far. Whatre you doing? Im ten yards from the goal line! Arent you going to try and catch me?!? I could crawl on my hands and knees to make a touchdown before youd ever get me from back there! Whats the matter with you?? Oops. Do you want to keep trying for the last two yards or just give me the ball now. I call a ten year time out to grow up some more.
16/11/87
Hi Susie. What do you have for lunch today? Dont even talk to me. I dont want to hear how disgusting you think my lunch is. My lunch is fine. Relax I wasnt going to say a word about your lunch. Pass me some salt will you please? Here. Thanks slugs are so chewy before you shrivel them up.
17/11/87
Im home. I read that tigers spinal columns are like big coiled springs! I read that their brains are like big bows of tapioca.
18/11/87
Blecchh! How long are those two gonna keep kissing? This program only lasts for an hour! Geez look at them slobbering over each others faces! Why would anybody do that? Do they like it? Bed time. Theres a connection here I just know it.
19/11/87
Quit hogging the bed. Youre way over on my side. Tough beans fuzz face. Ever thinka bout the geysers and waterfalls? Hundreds of thousands of gallons of water! Flowing spilling rushing gushing splashing. He really fights mean.
20/11/87
Spaceman Spiff flees the despicable scum beings of planet Q-13! In a surprise maneuver our hero turns to face the adversary! His hand tightens around the death ray trigger! It doesnt respond. Spiff reaches for the mertilizer beam but it doesnt work either! Neither do the phospho bombs or the mordo blasters! Nothing is working!! 1812! Gettysburg! 16 fluid ounces! I before E! Thomas Edison! Perhaps someone who has been paying attention can help out Calvin!
21/11/87
I keep forgetting that five of his six ends are pointy when he lies like that.
22/11/87
If you dont hurry up youll miss the school bus. Thats the best news Ive heard today. Lets see what should I wear today? Aaugh! Now boys! Get im. Help help help. Hold his arms! Grab his feet! Ok boys just like we planned! Striped pants polka dot shirt! Plaid jacket! Everybody on! Hey! Im not going out like this! Get off me! Lift his legs! Make him walk! Look at you! Have you gone colorblind?? I dont want to hear about it.
23/11/87
Since September its just gotten colder and colder. Theres less daylight now Ive noticed too. Oh no! This can mean only one thing! The sun is going out! In a few more months earth will be a dark and lifeless ball of ice! Well gee now I dont feel so bad about not setting up an IRA last year.
24/11/87
Dad says the sun isnt going out. He says its colder because the earths orbit is taking us farther from the Sun. He says winter will be here soon. Isnt it sad how some peoples grip on their lives is so precarious that theyll embrace any preposterous delusion rather than face an occasional bleak truth.

Are you going to live the last few months of your life differently now that the Sun is going out and were all doomed? No Ive always believed in living each day as if it was my last so I never have any regrets. Kind of inspiring huh? If you were someone else it might be. Pass me that issue of Captain Napalm will you?
26/11/87
My teacher said the same thing Dad did. The Sun isnt going out after all! Its just getting colder because winters coming. Dad was right all along. Imagine ol Dad knowing something like that!
27/11/87
Whats the story youre going to read me Dad? It doesnt have any romance in it does it? Uh ... Edit it out if it does. I hate romance. Does it have any boring description in it? Well ... Skip it if you see any. I like my stories fast and gripping. It doesnt have a moral does it I hate being told how to live my life. Skip the moral too. Ok? Does his majesty prefer color pictures or black and white?
28/11/87
The mighty destroyer patrols the seas! Suddenly the ship spins out of control! Its caught in a whirlpool! Within moments the giant vessel dips its hull into the swirling vortex and is never seen again! Oh no! Here goes the rest of the navy! Are you letting the water out already?
29/11/87
Calvin its time to wake up. Calvin its time to wake up. Cmon youll be late for school. My dreams are getting way to literal.
30/11/87
Im going to be the next Houdini! Tie me to this chair and Ill escape! Tie the knots tighter dont make it so easy for me. Tie my feet too. All right lets see y ou get out of that. Ha! The great Calvini can escape from anything! Calvin dinner time! Should I tell her youre tied up at the moment ha ha? Ill be (mmf) out of here (rrg) in no time gosh. I cant even move.
01/12/87
Your dinners getting cold Calvin! Ill be down in a second. You want me to help untie you? No! dont touch those ropes! I want to escape! Its easy. I just rock a little to loosen the knots no ropes can hold me! Whoop! Ow!! Good thing youre doing this here before you tried it under water.
02/12/87
Mmf! Gggk! Its no use. Youd better untie me I cant escape. Lets see this end goes in here and around over there. You know knots are pretty tricky. Hurry up. If I pull on this it should ... ahh! Thats tighter! Pull the other way! The other way! Calvin this is the last chance for dinner! Get down here! Sit tight. Ha ha! Ill get your cub scout manual. I dont believe this.
03/12/87
I always wanted to be a cub scout and get merit badges and stuff but I hate going to meetings. Ok ok. Just read about knots all right? Hey look heres a motto! I didnt know you had a motto! Wow what fun! Live for revenge is going to be my motto if you dont get me out of this. Ill quiz you. What do you for a second degree burn? Dont flip through the book you idiot! Untie me! Hmph if I was in your predicament Id treat me with a lot more respect. Do you say youre sorry? Mff! Rrggh! Ooh! You dirty rotten stinking.
04/12/87
Hobbes Im not kidding. If you dont get me loose in ten seconds ... You got yourself into this Mr Houdini not me. But Im supposed to be at dinner! Moms gonna kill me! Escape artists have a risky trade. Hey heres morse code! Ok Im sorry I called you names. I said Im sorry right? Now untie me. Heres how you say banana in morse. Dash dot dot dot dot dash ... What is that kid doing?! It sounds like a chair thumping around the room. Well his dinner is stone cold. I hope hes happy.
05/12/87
All right young man! Youve wasted the nice meal your mom fixed. Get out here. You tied yourself up?? What on earth were you doing?! Hobbes tied me up Dad! Its his fault. Dont make up lies Calvin. How did you get yourself like this?! Hobbes did it Dad! He was going to hold me for ransom! Honest! Ransom?? Whod pay for you you big fibber?! Im certainly glad your dad saw through that filthy lie! Oh hush. You always get me in trouble.
06/12/87
First there was nothing ... then there was Calvin! Calvin the mighty god creates the universe with pure will! Form utter nothingness comes swirling form! Life begins where once was void! But Calvin is no kind and loving god! Hes one of the old gods! He demands sacrifice. Yes Calvin is a god of the underworld! And the puny inhabitants of earth displease him! The great Calvin ignores their please for mercy and the doomed writhe in agony! Have you seen how absorbed Calvin is with those tinkertoys? Hes creating whole worlds over there! Ill be he grows up to be an architect.
07/12/87
Whats for dinner Mom? Tortellini. Oh no not tortellini! I hate tortellini!! Oh gross! Yecch! Tortellini!! Nothing is more disgusting than tortellini!! Cant we have something else? No. tortellini ... tortellini ... t - o - r ...
08/12/87
Did you see we have a substitute teacher today? Oh no! that can only mean our real teacher rocketed back to Saturn to report to her superiors! Theyre trying to subvert us little kids with subliminal messages in our text books telling us to turn in our parents when the Saturnians attack! Earth will be rendered helpless! I think one of us has been eating too much paste in art class. Im to smart for them though! I dont read my assignments!
09/12/87
Behold the terrible thunder lizard Tyrannosaurus Rex! The fiercest dinosaur of all he is twenty tons of bone crushing muscle and razor sharp teeth! Always the victor he lets out a triumphant roar!
10/12/87
I juth hade it whed thith happedth.
11/12/87
Calvin the criminal is about to face justice! Angry throngs turn out to watch his execution! As he is led up the gallows he reflects upon his many heinous crimes. He is not repentant! The noose is put around his neck and tightened! This is the end! Gackk! Urrgh! Oh nock it off. Some of us have to wear a tie every day.
12/12/87
How was the kiddy matinee movie? Movie? Oh yeah the movie. Yeah there was a movie it was ok I guess. How was the matinee? We are buying a video player.
13/12/87
That sigh ought to get me out of a few years purgatory.
14/12/87
Open your moth and close your eyes and youll get a big surprise. Ready? Here it ... hey! Youre peeking! Whats the matter? Dont you trust your own kid?! Cmon close your eyes! Uh oh hang on he got away.
15/12/87
Anything yet? Not one snowflake.
16/12/87
Dear Santa. Attached is my Christmas list for this year. Last year I did not receive several items from my list. For your convenience I have grouped those items together on page 12. Please check them carefully and include them with the rest of my loot this year. Thats the problem with this guy. Hes gotten sloppy without any competition.
17/12/87
He sees when youre sleeping he knows when youre awake. He knows if youve been bad or good so be good for goodness sake! Click. Santa Claus: kindly old elf or CIA spook?
18/12/87
This Santa Claus stuff bothers me ... especially the judge and jury bit. Who appointed Santa? How do we know he is impartial? What criteria does he use for determining good and bad? And what about extenuating circumstances? Kids should have the benefit of legal counsel dont you think? Youre worried about the salamander incident arent you? Temporary insanity! Thats all it was!
19/12/87
They say Santa knows if youve been good or bad but what if someone had been sort of both? I mean suppose some kid tried to be good ... at least well most of the time. But bad things inexplicably kept happening? Suppose some kid just had terrible luck and he got blamed for lots of things he did only sort of on purpose. Who exactly might we be talking about? This is a purely hypothetical case Mr. Smartypants.
20/12/87
Can we get this tree Mom? Can we? I dont know Calvin. Its awfully expensive. Yeah but just think how much loot would fit under it! Dad! Come bring in the Christmas tree Mom and I picked! Its a great one! This year I thought wed just keep the tree in the garage. In the garage?! Sure. You can go out and look at it any time you like. And it saves all the trouble of decorating it. Were not going to decorate it?! Why bother? We just take it all down in two weeks on Christmas day. If you get a present. If I get a present? You can take it out to the garage to open and pretend the tree has lots of lights and ... Mommmmm! I know somebody whos going to get a lot of coal in his stocking buster. This season gets less jolly every year.
21/12/87
This whole Santa Claus thing just doesnt make sense. Why all the secrecy? Why all the mystery? If the guy exists why doesnt he ever show himself and prove it? And if he doesnt exist whats the meaning of all this? I dunno ... isnt this a religious holiday? Yeah but actually Ive got the same questions about God.
22/12/87
Gosh Hobbes what if I dont get any presents this year because I doubted the existence of Santa? Suppose hes putting my name on the bad list right now! That would be awful! Personally Id think that if you werent on the bad list all along this wouldnt push you over. Thanks for the comfort eggnog brain. See? See why youre on the bad list? Insults!
23/12/87
Well Ive decided I do believe in Santa Claus no matter how preposterous he sounds. What convinced you? A simple risk analysis. I want presents. Lots of presents. Why risk not getting them over a matter of believe? Heck Ill believe anything they want. How cynically enterprising of you. Its the spirit of Christmas.
24/12/87
Psst! Are you awake? Of course. I havent heard Santa yet have you? Do you think hes coming? Its only 11:00. We maybe later on the route. Thump? Gasp did you hear that? Its him! Its Santa! Shh! Hes saying something! Slippin rippin dang fang rotten zarg barg-a-ding dong! Quiet dear! Calvin will hear you!
25/12/87
We got presents! Santa came! He came! He came! Oh no its not morning already? Well technically yes ...
26/12/87
Bath time Calvin! Come on lets just get it over with this time all right? Where are you? Lets go! Shell never look here.
27/12/87
Heres a box of crayons. I need some illustrations for a story Im writing. You can draw something besides tigers cant you? Sure. Leopards pumas ocelots ... you name it. Here dad read this story tonight. I wrote it and Hobbes illustrated it. Um ok. The dad who lived to regret being mean to his kid. What are you pausing for? Keep reading. Barneys dad was really bad so Barney hatched a plan. When his dad said Eat your peas! Barney shouted No! and ran. Barney tricked his mean ol dad. And locked him in the cellar. His mom never found out where hed gone. Cause Barney didnt tell her. There his dad spent his life. Eating mice and gruel. With every bite for fifty years he was sorry hed been cruel. The end. You know how a lot of stories have morals to them? I get it I get it!
28/12/87
What do you think is the meaning of true happiness? Is it money cars and women? Or is it just money and cars? Well?
29/12/87
Look at this! You call this snow?! Its not even an inch high! What good is less than an inch of snow?! Well its pretty. Nobody ever closed a school on account of prettiness.
30/12/87
This will be the strongest snow fort ever made! Keep packing on snow. This will be indestructible. Well pour water on it so it freezes overnight. That way our fort will be here until July! Wheres that kid?!
31/12/87
This snow fort can repel any attack! I hate this neighborhood.
01/01/88
Whap! Im glad to see youre inside. Its handy not to have to boots and a coat to take off.
02/01/88
My snow fort makes me invulnerable! From behind its thick wall I can launch a brutal snowball barrage and remain safe from retaliation! Whap! Youre supposed to attack from that side of the fort dummy!!
03/01/88
Did you make any resolutions for the new year? Heck no. Im just fine the way I am! Why should I change? In fact I think its high time the world started changing to suit me! I dont see why I should do all the changing around here! If the new year requires resolutions I say its up to everyone else not me! I dont need to improve! Everyone else does! How about you did you make any resolutions? Well I had resolved to be less offended by human nature but I think I blew it already.
04/01/88
I hate waiting for the school bus on days like these. Blustery cold days should be spent propped up in bed with a mug of hot chocolate and a pile of comic books. Thats what Id like to be doing right now. As soon as I graduate Im going to spend every winter that way. I wish you bus would come my hot chocolate will get cold.
05/01/88
Help me figure out this homework problem Hobbes. Whats 3 + 8. Ok assign the answer a value of x. x always means multiply so take the numerator (thats latin for number eighter) and put that on the other side of the equation. That leaves you with three on this side so what times three equals eight? The answer of course is six. Gosh I must have done all the others wrong. These problems seem awfully advanced for first grade if you ask me.
06/01/88
Heres another math problem I cant figure out. Whats 9 + 4? Ooh thats a tricky one. You have to use calculus and imaginary numbers for this. Imaginary numbers?! You know eleventeen thirty-twelve and all those ... its a little confusing at first. How did you learn all this? Youve never gone to school! Instinct tigers are born with it.
07/01/88
Its freezing in this house! Somebody crank up the thermostat! Why doesnt someone make a fire?! If we cant afford to heat this place maybe dad should get a better job! Why cant we move to Florida?! Calvin pipe down and put on a sweater if youre cold. And go to all that trouble?!
08/01/88
I read that the average household watches 7.5 hours of TV every day. Mom says she doesnt watch TV at all while Im at school. So if we get home at 3:00 I should be able to watch it straight till 10:30 right? Wrong. Do you want us to be sub-average?!
09/01/88
Mom the washer is done. Ok. Arent you going to put the wash in the dryer? In a minute. You mean you are just going to let it sit in the washing machine?!? Calvin cant you see Im busy right now?? She says shes busy. I hope the next time she takes a bath there arent any towels.
10/01/88
Two parts slush one part solid ice one part hard-packed snow a dash of assorted debris. Sculpt into a sphere and serve at high velocity without warning. Oh boy here comes Susie! Hey Susie! Whap! Ha ha! I gotcha you dumb girl!! Aughh! My eyeball! Wheres my eyeball! What are you talking about? I hit you in the back. It knocked my eyeball out! Find it and pack it in snow so they can save it. Ooh. Ooh. Gosh did you really lose your eyeball? I didnt know they came out! Wow. Im really sorry. I didnt mean to knock it out. Can I see the socket? Boy where do you suppose it rolled. Somewhere over there poop head!! Boot! What are you doing? My eyeball fell out. Help me look for it.
11/01/88
Whos coming to visit? Your Uncle Max. I thought I told you. Uncle Max?? I dont remember any Uncle Max. Are you sure hes related? Maybe hes a con man trying to swindle us! Of course hes related. Hes your dads brother. He just hasnt been here for a few years. Why not? Was he in jail? No! good heavens Calvin. Now now ... with Max thats not a bad guess.
12/01/88
Were getting near the airport Calvin. See the jets? How come youre so quiet back there? Arent you excited to see Uncle Max? Yeah. I just hope nobody thinks Im giving up my room while hes here.
13/01/88
Its great to see you Max! It seems like ages since youve been here. Ill say. I didnt think it had been so long until I saw Calvin. This guy has really grown. So kid what do you say? I say youd better watch your step cause Ive got a live man-eating tiger at home and if I so much as wink hell rip your lungs out. cute kid bro.
14/01/88
And this is my room Uncle Max. I dont know where youre sleeping but it sure isnt here. Gotcha nice room. This is Hobbes. I wouldnt get too close if I was you. Dont worry he looks like a fierce one. Yep. Mandibles of death thats what hes got. And a killers yee. You can tell. I think Ill go downstairs. Ol Uncle Max seems pretty sharp. Hard to believe hes related to dad. A killers eye he said. Wow! I wonder which one!
15/01/88
Hey! Hey kid what are you doing?! Im going through your luggage. Whats it look like Im doing? Did mommy and daddy raise you themselves or did they just untie you for my visit? Didnt you bring me a present? I cant find one anywhere.
16/01/88
Is this my place? Cant I sit over there? I want to sit next to Uncle Max. Can I? Please? Please? Ok go ahead. Move your chair over. You should be flattered Max. Calvin asked to sit by you tonight. Hey thats sweet.
17/01/88
Ive got to go in. Another five minutes out here and Ill be frozen solid. Ooh I hope that was no one I knew. You looked pretty cold coming up the hill so I fixed you some hot chocolate and crackers with peanut butter. Go wrap up in a blanket and take these in front of the fire. Heres Hobbes and a comic book. Getting toasty? Uh huh. Thanks. She even put marshmallows in the chocolate. Nobody knows how to pamper like a mom. So are you going to eat all those peanut butter crackers yourself or what?
18/01/88
Do you have any kids Uncle Max? Me? Nope Im not even married. Oh. What difference does that make? Kid watches a lot of TV does he?
19/01/88
Boy Calvin takes that stuffed tiger everywhere he goes. Yeah theyre inseparable. Do you worry about that? I mean shouldnt he be playing with real friends? Oh I think he will when hes ready. Didnt you ever have an imaginary friend? Sometimes I think all my friends have been imaginary.
20/01/88
Uncle max look! Ill show you a magic disappearing trick! Ok first Ill need an ordinary twenty dollar bill. How about if I lend you a nickel instead? No it works much better with a twenty or a fifty if you have one. I take it you think your ol Uncle Max is a low-watt bulb. Why did Dad tell you how this works?
21/01/88
When are you going back home Uncle Max? Tomorrow. Is that soon enough? Gee I wish you could stay forever. What a nice thing to say! Youre all right Calvin. Moms a lot more patient with me in front of guests.
22/01/88
Well so long Max. It was great to see you again. You too. Have a safe trip home. Come visit me sometime ok fella? Heck Ill come right now! So long Mom! Bye Dad! Calvin get back here! I never get to do anything fun. Missed your chance dear. We couldve bought him a ticket. Well.
23/01/88
Are you just going to stay inside all day? You should go play outside and get some fresh air!
24/01/88
Seven eight nine net! Thats my square! Ha ha! you owe me money! Uh eleven! Just a minute! What are you doing? You cant just take money from the bank! Youve got hotels on every piece of property you own. I cant afford to pay you so Im sticking up the bank its a robbery! You cant do that! Im the banker right? Am I going my life over a few thousands dollars? The rules dont say you can rob the bank. Thats cheating. Do the rules say you cant rob the bank? Huh? Do they? Just roll the dice and accept this is a tragic turn of events ok? Ok if thats how were playing then Im robbing you! Ha! Ill steal your deeds to Park Place and Boardwalk! Yeah? Well Im taking all the houses and hotels and putting them on Baltic. Where you just landed! You owe me $250000! Thats what you think you you. Isnt it cute how Calvin plays both sides of Monopoly with his stuffed tiger? I dunno I overheard him using words he didnt learn in this household.
25/01/88
Aaghh I cant believe we were assigned to do a report together. All I can say is youd better do a great job! I dont want to flunk just because I was assigned a doofus for a partner. A doofus?? Who takes her sandwiches apart and eats each ingredient separately? Whats wrong with that? It certifies you as a grade a nimrod. It does not!
26/01/88
Ok look. Weve got to do this dumb project together so we might as well get it over with. What are we supposed to be doing? Werent you even paying attention. What would you do if I wasnt here to ask? Youd flunk and be sent back to kindergarten thats what! Says you! I heard that sometimes kids dont pay attention because the class goes at too slow a pace for them. Some of us are too smart for the class. Oh right. Youre too smart. Believe it lady. You know how Einstein got bad grades as a kid? Well mine are even worse!
27/01/88
So what are we supposed to be doing? Were supposed to be researching the planet Mercury. So what have we found out? nothing! Im not going to do this whole thing myself! Youd probably goof it all up if you did. Lets get started. Yes! Lets! Ill be the management and you can be the labor. First get some books. Does anyone want to trade partners?
28/01/88
What are you doing?! Youre doodling! Youre sitting here drawing martians when were supposed to be researching! You havent done anything yet! Dont you care?? Whats the matter with you?! Its no use! Were going to flunk! Ill have to go to a second-rate college because my idiot partner spent the study period drawing martians! Why me? Why me? Why me? Here this will cheer you up. The martian moves when you flip the pages! Watch you can see him eat an astronaut!
29/01/88
Look bird brain you wasted the entire week in the library. We have to give our report on Monday. Youd better bust your butt over the weekend or Im telling the teacher you didnt do any work. Got it? ... well what do you say?! Am I getting through to you?! This is important! Gronk! Gribble gok! Gak gork! Goonk!! Our hero regards the strange alien. ... it seems to be trying to communicate.
30/01/88
Calvin telephone! Why arent you at the library?!?
31/01/88
Planet Bog - pools of toxic chemicals buble under a choking atmosphere of poisonous gases. ... but aside from that its not much like Earth. We find Spaceman Spiff struggling across the terrain of distant planet! Suddenly the ground begins to shake! A cloud of dust appears on the horizon! Its a Zorg!! Our hero runs for cover but the Zorg is instantly upon him! Spiff fires his blaster but the weapon is useless agains the monster! The fearless space explorer is taken to the Zorgs cave where he discovers a vat of boiling water! Oh no! our hero is about to be cooked alive! Spiffs mind races furiously. Well? Get in. Dont you want to lean way way over and test how hot the water is?
01/02/88
We have to give our report on planet Mercury today. Did you do your half? Of course I did. And Ill bet my half makes your half look pathetic. It had better be good ... or else! The planet Mercruy. An exhaustively researched report by Calvin.
02/02/88
... and so the planet Mercury is a hot and barren world the closest to our sun. And to tell us about the mythology of mercury heres my partner Calvin. Thank you thank you! Hey what a crowd! You look great this morning ... really I mean that! Go on give yourselves a hand! You know a funny thing happened on the way to the library yesterday ... This isnt my fault Miss Wormwood!
03/02/88
The planet Mercury was named after a roman god with winged feet. Mercury was the god of flowers and bouquets which is why today he is a registered trademark of FTD florists. Why they named a planet after this guy. I cant imagine. ... um back to you Susie.
04/02/88
Boy you shouldve seen the sparks fly when I gave my half of the report. Ive never seen Susie so mad. She accused me of not doing my research and claimed I made up the whole thing. Did you? Heck no. I just took a few creative liberties. And they called your mom over a few creative liberties? Geez you think Susie was mad.
05/02/88
Dont you hate it when your boogers freeze?
06/02/88
Here we are overlooking suicide gulch about to hurl ourselves down at breakneck speed in a sled that hardly steers! Risking life and limb! Looking at death straight in the eye! Why? You ask! Why do we do it?? Because we get paid I hope. Because its there!
07/02/88
Im going outside! Ill be out back if anyone wants me! Ill probably be gone a couple hours! Im leaving now! Im going! So long! Se you later! Bye! Stomp stomp stomp. Hey Susie look! I found dinosaur tracks! Pretty scary huh? Ill be you didnt know there were dinosaurs in this neighborhood! Especially not dinosaurs with size 5 treaded toes.
08/02/88
Look Hobbes the latest perfection in technology. A water pistol? Heck no! this is the new improved version of the transmogrifier. Now you can transmogrify things just by pointing at them! Say you dont like the color of your bedspread. Well you just zap it and presto its an iguana! One can certainly imagine the myriad of uses for a hand-held iguana maker. It doesnt have to be an iguna. It can be anything. Suppose moms getting on our nerves for instance.
09/02/88
How does the transmogrifier gun know what to transmogrify something into? Telepathy. The gun automatically reads the brain waves you emit and turns the object into whatever you want. Thats amazing. Well it took me all morning to invent. So say Im thinking about a big slab of grilled tuna now. Watch where youre pointing that! Watch where youre pointing that!
10/02/88
Ok lets test this transmogrifier gun. I want to be a pterodactyl so you think of one and point the transmogrifier at me. This will be great. Ill terrorize the neighborhood awhile and then you can transmogrify me back to a boy when the national guard comes. Whats a pterodactyl? Some kind of bug? No no! its a big flying dinosaur! Dont shoot me if you dont know what it is!!
11/02/88
A chicken?? You transmogrified me into a chicken! You were supposed to turn me into a pterodactyl you nincompoop! All you had to do was think of a pterodactyl! Why did you think of a chicken? Its almost lunchtime. Oh I see well Im glad you werent hungry for a hotdog!
12/02/88
Heres the transmogrifier gun. Now try again and do it right. I want to be pterodactyl. Ok here you go. Well now thats more like it. Say when did you turn yourself into a 200-foot-tall colossus? I didnt why?
13/02/88
You transmogrified me into a tiny pterodactyl?? Big dinosaurs give me the willies. You numbskull! How am I goinig to terrorize the neighborhood like this?? My arent you the cranky one today? By golly Ill show you! Ha ha! serves you right! You my friend just made a big mistake.
14/02/88
There! Now were both transmogrified. Were even! Even?? We would be even only if turning a tiger into a duck was an improvement. This wasnt at all what I had in mind when I asked you to transmogrify me into a pterodactyl. Pterodactyls are big! So you turned me into a duck. Is that it? Fairs fair. Ok Ill take the transmogrifier and fix you up right. Zap! Why you gimmie that gun! Thbbt! Zap! An insult! This is worse than before!! Zap! Zap! Zap! Great just great. Which one of us is Calvin and which is Hobbes huh? Well I hope Calvin is you because his moms going to have a fit when she sees this.
15/02/88
Look Ill transmogrify you back to a tiger if you transmogrify me back to a kid ok? Ok. Zap! Ahh thats much better. Now do me. Click ... click ... click. Whats wrong?? Im not transmogrifying! Boy Im glad we did me first.
16/02/88
Whats wrong with the transmogrifier? Why wont it work?? You invented it. You tell me. Dont tell me Im stuck as an owl for the rest of my life! I think owls mostly eat mice. I suppose we could catch some in the yard. This is awful! What am I going to do?! Uggh I could never eat a mouse raw. Their little feet are probably real cold going down. Will you forget the stupid mice and help me think? I wonder if pet stores will sell you a mouse if you know youre going to eat it?
17/02/88
Hi mom Im an owl. You dont look like a very happy owl. Nope. Im not. Maybe some lunch would help. I doubt it. I dont like mice. This is soup. Is it mouse soup? I dont like mice. I heard you. Its tomato.
18/02/88
What am I going to do Hobbes? I cant be an own forever! How am I going to transmogrify back into a kid when the transmogrifier is broken? Maybe you should just learn to accept this predicament. Its not so bad being an owl instead of a kid. Actually its probably better. Better?? How? Well I never quite knew how to say this before but little boys dont smell so good.
19/02/88
Ive got to go to school tomorrow morning! What will the kids say if Im an owl?! Oh no. Im doomed! Im doomed! Since when do owls go to school? Zip-a-dee-doo-dah. My oh my what a wonderful day!
20/02/88
Time to get up Calvin. You dont want to miss the school bus. Im not going to school Mom. Im an owl. No youre not. Now get up and get dressed. Im not an owl? Im not! Im me again! The transmogrification must only be temporary! It wore off overnight! Im a kid! I can ... go to school. Yawwwnnn ... keep the shade down when you go ok?
21/02/88

22/02/88
Ding dong. Ill get it. Hobbes quick close the curtains and help me prop furniture against the door! Its Rosalyn!
23/02/88
Dad! Dad! Where do you keep your guns? Get out the magnum! I dont have any guns. Whats the problem? Rosalyns here and she wont go away! Why on earth dont you have any guns? Your mom and I are going out. Rosalyn is here to baby-sit. Dont you remember? I told you that this morning? You just dont pay attention. Thats why you never know whats going on. How about a wooden stake and a mallet? Do we have that?!
24/02/88
Can you believe it Hobbes? Mom and Dad asked Rosalyn to baby-sit us? Theres just one thing to do. Well mail ourselves to Australia. Climb in. just put us out by the mailbox Mom. Stop being silly Calvin. Wheres Rosalyn? I thought you said she was here. As far as I know shes still on the front porch why? You didnt let her in?! ding dong.

Come in Rosalyn! Im sorry! We didnt realize Calvin hadnt let you in. Thats ok. It wasnt too cold and wet out. Were late help yourself to anything in the fridge. Well see you at ten. The door was jammed. Really. I couldnt get it open. Bed.
26/02/88
Hey dont fix that for dinner! Didnt Mom tell you Hobbes and I are on a strict Big Mac diet? Its doctors orders! Oh Id better call your doctor then! Oh no she called my bluff! The doctors gonna be furious! Boy are we going to get ti! We? Im dialing! Hello doctor? Im calling about Calvins dietary needs. ... at the tone the time will be 6:27 and 10 seconds. Beep. Bad news Calvin. Your doctor says you should have a spoonful of castor oil and lie down all evening. He did? Really? No he didnt. did he? Whats castor oil?
27/02/88
Mom doesnt set the table this way. Mom does it a lot better. This food smells funny. This isnt the way Mom fixes it. I like the way Mom does it better. Im not your mom all right?!? No kidding! My mom loves me more than life itself and she lets me do anything I want. Not like you you nasty ol barracuda. I cant believe I postponed a date for this.
28/02/88
My dad is a big ... hey! I think wed better get that kid to a psychologist.
29/02/88
Ill get it. I think its for me. Hello? Hi Charlie thanks for calling. Yeah this little freaks driving me up the wall ... what? No. Charlie this is Calvin on the other phone! Listen to me! Your girlfriends a sadistic kid-hater! Dont ever marry her! Shed be a terrible mother! She uh oh. Gotta go! After Charlie dumps you hell thank me!
01/03/88
Rosalyn sent us to bed and its not even our bedtime yet! Weve got to escape. Heres the plan: you start moaning and when Rosalyn comes in. Ill throw this blanket over her. Well tie her up and make our getaway got it? Got it. Mrowryowowwrrr. Rosalyn come quick! Theres something wrong with Hobbes! Right Calvin. What should I do call a vet? No just come up here and close your eyes.
02/03/88
Were home! Hi Rosalyn. How was Calvin tonight? Oh that bad eh? And a five dollar advance on the next time. Here you are. Good night thanks again. Shes got a real racket going doesnt she? What do you want to do stay home ever night until Calvins eighteen?
03/03/88
Hey Calvin guess what were doing in gym today. Were wrestling! Next period youll be so covered with mat burns youll need skin grafts! Ha ha ha! See ya then twinky. Sighhhh. Physical education is what you learn from having your face in someones armpit right before lunch.
04/03/88
Kapwinggg! Its Calvin the human light particle! In the blink of an eye hes 165000 miles away! Nothing in the universe is faster than Calvin! I hope!
05/03/88
Much as I love my Chocolate Frosted Crunchy Sugar Bombs. The best part is after the cereal is gone. Thats when you eat all the leftover milk thats all sludgy from the extra sugar you added. Sometimes I eat two or three bows of this. I can hear your heart racing from here. They make this cereal with marshmallow bits too but Mom wont buy it for me.
06/03/88
Its freezing upstairs! Can I take some logs up to my room? Hey youre on my side of the bed. These sheets are freezing! Yeah well aaughh! Your feet are like ice! Get away from me! But my sides all cold! Well dont get me cold! Move over. Sure youve got a fur coat! Im just wearing pajamas. Quit pulling the blankets willya? I hardly have any you hot! Gimmie those! Youre letting in cold air! Quit it! Quit it! Serves you right Mr. Mosty-Toasty! See what its like being cold! Yaaaah!! Eat feathers fuzz ball! Move over. Youre getting my side all hot. Open the window Im roasting.
07/03/88
Hey Calvin! Guess what time it is! Why? What time is it? Its a very special time! Oh boy oh boy! What time is it? Do you really want to know? Yes yes! Tell me! Tell me! Quick! Please! Yes! Its your bath time! Oh boy! You know how old people always write to Dear Abby complaining that their kids never write call or visit? Those letters really crack me up.
08/03/88
I hate being a kid. Somebodys always telling you what to do or what not to do. Do this! Stop that! Day after day. Youre lucky youre a tiger. Well we try to stay humble but lord knows its hard. I wonder if I can grow fangs when my baby teeth fall out.
09/03/88
I wish I was a tiger. A common lament. Ive got an idea! You can teach me to be a tiger! Ive got some red sleepers I can wear! Hang on! See? We can make a tail by stuffing a knee sock and pinning it on my rear! Then you can draw stripes on my face! Hmm ... what about fur and whiskers? I havent shaved for six years. I seem to be cursed with a thin beard.
10/03/88
gee Im getting more like a tiger every minute. Hold still while I draw stripes. How do I look? Its some improvement. Rowrr rrghgh rawrr. I dunno youre still lacking something tigger-ish. Panache. Thats it. Wiat Ive got some plastic vampire fangs I can put in!
11/03/88
Thats great Hobbes! Im a tiger! Well being a tiger is more than just stripes you realize. Kind of a zen thing huh? You have to think like a tiger. Yowwow Im hungry! Whats for dinner? Hows that? Har har. Do you want me to teach you anything or not?
12/03/88
Ok were tigers. Were out in the wilderness. Teach me how to survive. Lets say were hiding up in a tree. Our keen tiger eyes and noses detect some prey nearby. What do we do? I suppose it would depend on what kind of prey it was. I dont care pick something. Well if its a box of rigatoni noodles first you would go put on some water ...
13/03/88
The late Cretaceous period ... when dinosaurs ruled the Earth! And Calvin ruled the dinosaurs! The terrible Tyrannosaurus sinks it teeth into a triceratops! Triumphant again the undisputed king of dinosaurs lets out a mighty roar! With savage ferocity the monster begins its feast! Limb-severing bone-crushing and tendon-snapping he ... Calvin! Thats disgusting! For heavens sake slow down and chew quietly! The terrible Tyrannosaurus resumes eating mortified that someone might see him.
14/03/88
Hobbes youre supposed to be teaching me how to be a tiger. Weve been sitting in this dumb tree all morning and you havent taught me how to hunt or anything! Its instinct. You cant teach that. Well if you wont help Ill just go look up tiger in the encyclopedia. As long as were going in lets fix some soup and sandwiches ok? You know what you are? A disgrace thats what.
15/03/88
This book says tigers are solitary and secretive creatures. True very true. Secretive? Oh sure! You wouldnt believe some of the secrets I know. Really? Like what? I cant tell you theyre secrets. You can tell me! I wont blab! Honest! Tell me! Please? Big secrets! Secret secrets! Boy if you only knew! Mm-mm!
16/03/88
I dont believe you even have a secret. Thats right I dont. yes you do! Tell me it! Pleeeze? No! why not? Why cant you tell me? Its about you. Aaahhh! What is it? Tell me! Tell me! Ive said too much already.
17/03/88
If you wont tell me your secret I wont be your friend anymore. Ill give you a hint hows that? Ok! Shoot. The flea market. The flea market? What kind of lousy hint is that? Do you know how your parents got you? I was ... why? What are you saying? No more hints.
18/03/88
I dont believe your dumb ol secret about my parents getting me at a flea market. Its true. It is not and if all your secrets are lies you can just keep them to yourself. You just dont want to hear how little you went for. Oh hush up. This book also says tigers wont share their territory with other tigers. I can see how other tigers would get on ones nerves. A nickel. Thats how much you cost.
19/03/88
This book says tigers are territorial and wont share their ground with other tigers. I guess wed better divide up the woods then. This will be my territory and that will be yours. This rock will separate our two sides. As another tiger you are hereby banished from this side of the rock. Ha ha ha! Look what Im doing! You cut that out!
20/03/88
Uh oh Ill bet Hobbes is waiting to spring on me as soon as I open the front door! I know Ill sneak around back and surprise him! Heh heh! There he is all ready to pounce! What a sucker! Im home! Ive got to start listening to those quiet nagging doubts.
21/03/88
My side of the woods is abound in natural scenic splendor. Your side wallows in decay and filth. My territory is infinitely superior to yours. Your side is smaller. Hey!
22/03/88
Im hungry. Well you cant catch anything in my territory. Thats what the book says. What do tigers eat in the wild anyway? They catch big gross caterpillars like that one. Ewww. Its got little spikes all over him. Tigers really eat these? By the truckload. Theyre great. Let me see the book. Who are you going to believe some silly writer or a real tiger?
23/03/88
So far I havent had much fun as a tiger. I thought wed be romping around the woods like we always do but it turns out tigers dont share their territories with other tigers! So here we are sitting on opposite sides of a big rock. What a blast. Being a tiger just isnt all its cracked up to be. Thats not the half of it. It says here were an endangered species!
24/03/88
Were endangered? It says tigers nearly faced extinction and their future remains in doubt. Thats awful. Ill say. No offense but I think Ill go back to being a kid again. This explains why I dont meet many babes.
25/03/88
Im home! Pow! Gald to see me?? What I would give to be a latchkey kid.
26/03/88
Im home! Wham! Youll notice I didnt say I was inside.
27/03/88
A red spaceship? On the monitor your vileness. Its that infernal Spaceman Spiff! Open fire! Spaceman Spiff is hit! He aims for planet Mok hoping to find a reputable body shop. We join our hero after a crash landing on the hostile planet Mok. Ominous figures appear in the horizon. The daring Spaceman Spiff lays waste with his death ray zorcher but he is hopelessly outnumbered! Surrounded our hero is taken prisoner and carried to a subterranean dungeon! Still wont talk eh Spiff? Well see about that! Youll never get anything from me space squid! You had your chance earthling! Take him to the interrogation room and wash his hair! Aaugh! You got soap in my eyes on purpose! Sinister fiend! If youd stop thrashing around maybe it wouldnt happen!
28/03/88
Lightning flashes! Thunder rumbles across the sky! Horrible Calvin has been sewn together from corpses! A power surge forces blood to his brain! Hes ... hes alive! Well look whos up and about. Hello sleepyhead.
29/03/88
Calvin wakes up staring into the eyes of a big frog. Seeing Calvin awake the frog scrambles down and forces open Calvins mouth! Calvin tries to fight but the slippery amphibian instantly slides in and is swallowed! How disgusting! I dont feel good. You sound awful. Youve got a frog in your throat.
30/03/88
Calvin the elephant wanders the African plain. At five tons he is the largest land animal! His deafening call shatters the early morning tranquility!
31/03/88
I read that a cheetah can run 65 miles an hour can tigers run that fast? Of course. Really? Lets see you do it. Oh I cant now. Yeah? Why not? Im not wearing my drag chute.
01/04/88
Why do you suppose were here? Because we walked here. No no. I mean here on Earth. Because Earth can support life. No I mean why are we anywhere? Why do we exist? Because we were born. Forget it. I will thank you.
02/04/88
Saturday is the best day of the week. No demands at all! Perfect freedom! The whole day stretches before us with unlimited opportunity! And what better way to appreciate that opportunity than by squandering it watching cartoons all day!
03/04/88
Will you get me a glass of water? You just had one. I want one to keep by the bed so I can douse this guy if he starts snoring. Good night Calvin. Hee hee hee. Oh great hes dreaming again. Sniff. Where do you think you are you imbecile? Out in the jungle? Mm ... heh heh. If he starts running hes gonna get a pillow in the kisser. Sniff. Hey! Where are you going? Somnambulists give me the creeps. Why are we going to the kitchen? Calvin! What are you doing? Have you been sleepwalking? I was completely awake! Its this dope whos sleepwalking! I just followed him. I put him back to bed he couldnt give any reason for being up. Do you suppose it means anything? Look he got out all the tuna!
04/04/88
Ahh! Lunch my favorite meal! And todays lunch is extra special! Ever since the weather got warm Ive been swatting flies and saving them in a jar. Finally I got enough bugs to mash them into a gooey paste with a spoon. Ill call it bug butter. Care for a taste? Tell me Calvin. Do you have any friends at all?
05/04/88
Ok youve all read the chapter so who can tell me whats important about the battle of Lexington? Anyone? Calvin how about you? Hard to say maam. I think my cerebellum just fused.
06/04/88
Hey Mom can we go out for hamburgers tonight? Not tonight dear. Aw Mom! Why not? Because Im already fixing something for dinner. Yeah ... I know.
07/04/88
Why does the sun set? Its because hot air rises. The suns hot in the middle of the day so it rises high in the sky. In the evening then it cools down and sets. Why does it go from east to west? Solar wind. Dear!
08/04/88
Im thinking of a number between one and seven hundred billion. Try to guess it. Eleven? Nope. guess again. Six million and four. Nope. Guess again. Whats the matter dont you like games??
09/04/88
Do you believe our destinies are determined by the stars? Nah. Oh I do. Really? How come? Lifes a lot more fun when youre not responsible for your actions.
10/04/88
Despite that amazing display of cunning reflex and physical prowess your tail still has a death grip on your butt. Could you stop the room please? Id like to get off.
11/04/88
Your polls dad. You dropped another five points. It seems that although your recognition factor is high the scandals of your administration continue to haunt you. Scandals? What scandals? Bedtimegate and homeworkgate come readily to mind. Instances of true leadership. History will vindicate me. I wonder what my new dad will look like.
12/04/88
Youll be glad to know Ive analyzed your poor showing in the polls. Ill bet. See your record in office is miserable and the character issue is killing you. Your basic approval rating among six-year-olds hardly registers. If anyone ever needed a slick ad campaign its you. Let me guess what you have in mind. The new Dad I call it.
13/04/88
I think the image we need to create for you is repentant but learning. You know show some humility and present yourself as a regular guy trying to learn the ropes of a difficult job. Difficult doesnt begin to describe it. I worked up some slogans. See what you think. Dad-gradually he catches on. Vote Dad! This time hell do better. To forgive is divine - vote Dad in 88. I get the idea Calvin.
14/04/88
If you want to stay Dad youve got to polish your image. My image. Right see now everyone think your insensitive to the legitimate needs of minors. A few magnanimous gestures while in office now might be in order. If your minds gone blank I have some suggestions. Oh the suspense. For example you might repeal mandatory school attendance. That alone could rocket you to victory.
15/04/88
Much as I appreciate your offer I dont need an image consultant. I prefer to let the wisdom of my words and deeds speak for themselves. In that case youll have a lot of time to write your memoirs. Well see. Now its past your bedtime. Dad buried in landslide! Jubliant throngs fill streets! Stunned father inconsolable-demands recount! Good night.
16/04/88
Eight nine ten! Here I come ready or not! All right give em back!
17/04/88
I call this lookout hill. Yes you can certainly see far from up here. I call it lookout hill because thats what you yell whenever we go down it. You know sometimes it seems things go by too quickly. Were so busy watching out for whats just ahead of us that we dont take the time to enjoy where we are. Days go by and we hardly notice them. Life becomes a blur. Often it takes some calamity to make us live in the present. Then suddenly we wake up and see all the mistakes weve made. But its too late to change anything. Its like ... its like ... Its like what? Its like SOMEthing ... I just cant think of it.
18/04/88
Here I am waiting for the bus. Eleven more years of school to go. Then college then maybe graduate school and then I work until I die. What kind of world is this?! You only get five years to be a kid?? What about exploring and discovering and playing? Those things are important too! Well you still have afternoons and weekends. Thats when I watch TV.
19/04/88
Look Hobbes I got a model airplane. Want to help me build it? Sure. Wow a Phantom jet. Look at all the little pieces. Here you put those pieces together and Ill do these. Then well stick yours on mine OK? Shouldnt we read the instructions? Do I LOOK like a sissy?
20/04/88
Hey these instructions are in three different languages. Uh oh I got glue on my hands. It starts in English but then it goes into French and Spanish. This stuff is worse than Mozzarella cheese. Its hard to believe this model is for ages six and up. Yecchh. What a mess. You have to be tri-lingual just to read the directions. I hope Mom likes this newspaper here on the floor because its sure not going anywhere.
21/04/88
Nuts! This wheel strut snapped. Why do they make em so darn small? I guess that was an optional piece. My wheel wont fit in the wheel well. Here let me try. Sometimes you just have to ... SNAP Darn it! This plane is in for some rough landings.
22/04/88
Look at this stupid model. It looks awful! Our plane doesnt look anything like the picture in the box. Maybe we can fix it when we paint it. I cant paint it like this. Look how good they did this. Howd they paint eyebrows on a pilot thats less than an inch tall?? I think thats a real jet superimposed on a plastic stand.
23/04/88
I hate this model. Nothing fit right the instructures were incomprehensible the decals ripped the paint slopped and the glue got everywhere. What a disaster. Six bucks completely down the drain. I cant think of an afternoon Ive enjoyed less. What a waste. What a dumb hobby. Of course with this for practice Ill bet we could do great on ANOTHER model! Lets get one of those clipper ships with all the riggings.
24/04/88
A voice cackles in Calvins radio. Enemy fighters at two oclock! Roger. What should I do until then? Calvins F-4 phantom screams across the sky! But whats this? The canopy glass is all smeared! He can hardly see through it! Oh no! THe throttle snaps off his hand! Calvins only hope is to land but the wheels refuse to open! Theyre stuck! Frantically Calvin tries to eject but the cockpit is fused together! His jet is a hopeless mess! Everything is going wrong! Stupid model.
25/04/88
Im not going to bed! I dont have to do what you say! I can do anything I want! ... uh ... heh heh Enjoy this while you can! Ill be a hulking surly teen-ager before you know it!!
26/04/88
Did you ever wonder if the person in the puddle is real and youre just a reflection of HIM? If that was true youd disappear as soon as the person in the puddle moved away from the puddle right? Gee I guess so. I hadnt thought of that.
27/04/88
BANG! BANG! BANG! Ha! Thats six shots! Youre out of bullets! Ive got you now you rustles! ZAP! ZAP? My cattle prod.
28/04/88
Hey Susie guess what I have in my hands! Is it disgusting? Um ... well ... Is it some creepy gooey thing that no one in his right mind would ever ever want to look at? Uh ... I suppose that depends on your point of view ... Forget it. Im not guessing. You might as well. Youre nine-tenths there.
29/04/88
Mom was I ever a grub? A what? You know. A larva. Did I really pupate at age two? Dont be disgusting! Of course not! Where did you ever get that awful idea? You should get your stories straight with Mom Mr. Britannica!
30/04/88
How can you stand these cartoons? Theyre just half-hour commercials for toys. And when theyre not boring theyre preachy. And these characters dont even MOVE. They just stand around blinking! What kind of cartoon is THAT? Meet my Dad the Gene Siskel of Saturday morning TV.
01/05/88
Good night Calvin. ... all right where are you?! Calvin I thought I said to get ready for bed! Now hurry up! I cant! Im trapped in slow motion! Well youd better get in normal speed ... now! Ahh! Time snap!
02/05/88
Can I use the garden shovel? What do you want it for? Hobbes and I are going on an archealogical expedition. If youre looking for fossilized remains you should dig through your room. Ha ha. Someday Ill name an Australopithecus woman after you.
03/05/88
Ive been reading up on paleontology. Its amazing stuff. Scientists can tell how old something is just by analyzing the layers of dirt its in. Hey! Why you must be six years old. Oh youre a scream.
04/05/88
Archeologists dig slowly and carefully using small delicate tools. Each rock has to be painstakingly brushed and scraped so nothing is broken or missed. DIG DIG SCRAPE SCRAPE BRUSH BRUSH Archeologists have the most mind-numbing job on the planet. I dont think your Dad will want to shave with this tomorrow.
05/05/88
Hey look! I hit something! Dont break it! Dig carefully! Gosh what do you suppose it is? Dust it off so we can see. Its some bizarre skull. Look at its mouth. Maybe its a prehistoric anteater.
06/05/88
Wow! I cant believe we found a dinosaur skull on our very first archealogical dig. Its completely intact too! What a discovery! Maybe the rest of the skeleton is nearby! Yeah! If we can find the whole thing well be world famous! With the grant money well get we can buy a Porsche! How will THIS look on the cover of National Geographic?
07/05/88
I found another bone! I found another bone! Boy this is a weird one. What is it? It could be a forearm and fingers. I cant wait to see what the complete Calvinosaur looks like. I didnt know bones came in decorator colors did you?
08/05/88
The call goes out! Were on the move! Up through the winding maze! Faster! Faster! Calvin scrambles up the grainy tunnel! Out he pops into the blinding sun! Calvin the and rushes down the hill to the brick walk! Other ants rush around him in their mad hurry! Calvin tries to keep up! At least he reaches the monstrous dead caterpiller! Without pausing he hoists it up! The queen demands his tireless toil! Calvin is back off to the ant-hill as fast as he can go! Work work work! Thats what Im good for around here! I hardly think picking up your room once in a while qualifies you as a slave.
09/05/88
Gosh look at all the dinosaur bones we discovered. Lets glue them together so we can see how they fit. Then you can draw a reconstruction of the actual dinosaur. After that well write up our findings and get them published in a scientific journal. Then well win the Nobel prize get righ and go on talk shows. What about babes? When do we get those?
10/05/88
Well. Heres the complete skeleton as near as I can figure out. Try to draw the dinosaur as it really looked with muscles and skin. Whats it doing? Whistling? You tell me. Maybe its puckering up.
11/05/88
See the dinosaur skeleton we discovered and assembled? Im going to call the natural history museum and tell them they can have it for ten billion dollars. Those are ... um ... peculiar bones. Do you think I should ask for more money? Thats not QUITE what I meant.
12/05/88
Mom says she doesnt think weve found a skeleton at all. She says we just dug up some trash somebody littered. Our dinosaur is a fraud. I guess it wouldnt be right to sell it to a museum then. Not at full price anyway.
13/05/88
Psst ... Susie! Can I copy your paper? NO. CALVIN!
14/05/88
AAAUGHH! I SKINNED MY KNEE! OOH! OW! AAUGHHH! OW! OW!
15/05/88
This is Calvin your captain speaking ... just to reassure you that yes there is someone up front. Calvin pilots the jet airliner across the country at 35000 feet. He is given clearance to land. But what is this? A plane from a rival airplane is making for the same runway to shave precious minutes off its schedule! Its a 600 mph game of chicken! Calvin pulls back on the throttle and lurches ahead! The other pilot tries to cut Calvin off with a sudden drop in altitude! Calvin switches on the fasten seat belt light in the cabin and does a barrel roll. At 5Gs Calvin hopes not to black out! As they close in on the runway the other pilot has no choice but to pull up and circle around again! Calvin wins! Hey Mom is it true I could get a pilots license at age 14? NO.
16/05/88
HOBBES! Youve got to help me! Im in big trouble! Whats the matter? You know how Dad said I could use his binoculars as longs as I was extra careful with them? Well I just broke them by accident! Now I need some advice. Should I run away or commit hara-kiri? Over the binoculars? Yeah. Maybe both.
17/05/88
Geez I cant believe I broke Dads binoculars! Hell blow every capillary in his body! Dad said I had to be very very careful with them and what do I do? I go and break them. Hell flay me alive! How did you do it anyway? I just dropped them. And they broke? Well I was tossing them at myself at the time as I ran down the sidewalk.
18/05/88
How much money do you have hobbes? Maybe we can buy Dad a new pair of binoculars before he gets home. Ive got thrity ... no thirty-five cents. Great. Ive got four dollars. Lets call the store. Hello? Id like to know how much a good pair of binoculars costs. ONE TO SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS?! DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT MY DADS GOING TO DO TO ME?!? He wont stop at killing you thats for sure. Uh UH.
19/05/88
I had no IDEA binoculars were so expensive! Were doomed! Were doomed! We? Why in the world did Dad let me use anything so valuable?! He shouldve KNOWN Id break them! He mustive been out of his mind! This is all HIS fault! WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?! I suppose you COULD just tell him what happened ... ... and make my getaway when the coronary hits? Say THATs an idea!
20/05/88
Maybe we could GLUE Dads binoculars back together and he wouldnt even notice! You think? It depends. Was the casing just chipped a little or did the lens itself get cracked? Well maybe youd better look at it. Dont sneeze.
21/05/88
Maybe you should tell your MOM about the binoculars. And she can help somehow. Tell Mom?!? Are you crazy?? Now way! Why not? Youve got to tell SOMEONE. Maybe she can think of something. At times like these all Mom can think of is how long she was in labor with me.
22/05/88
I got a hit! I got a hit! Only because I LET you! Ha ha! A home run! You didnt touch all the bases! I did too. No you didnt. You didnt touch seventh base. Yes I did! I touched the water barrel right after the front porch. Thats not seventh base. Thats twelfth base! I thought the garage door was the twelfth. The garage door is the twenty-third base. You touched them all out of order. And you still didnt touch the secret base. The SECRET base?? Whats the secret base?! I cant tell you. Its a secret. I cant believe this moronic sport is our national pastime. Youre out. Give me a dollar.
23/05/88
Look at Dad calmly eating his dinner as if nothing was wrong. I know him. His Dad radar is beeping like crazy. He knows I broke SOMETHING he just doesnt know WHAT. He cant nail me until he knows for sure. Hell just wait. I know him. Hes going to just sit there eating and let me stew in my own guilt. He figures sooner or later Ill crack. Calvin? AUGH! I DID IT! I DID IT! IM SORRY! I DIDNT MEAN TO!! ... pass the uh ... the uh ...
24/05/88
YOU BROKE THE BINOCULARS?! DIDNT I TELL YOU TO BE EXTRA EXTRA CAREFUL WITH THEM?? ISNT THAT EXACTLY WHAT I SAID?! WELL?! THOSE BINOCULARS WERE BRAND NEW! HAVE YOU NO RESPECT FOR OTHER PEOPLES PROPERTY?!? I have an idea Dad. Lets pretend I already feel terrible about it and that you dontneed to rub it in any more.
25/05/88
I didnt MEAN to break your binoculars Dad. It was an accident. (sniff) Im really sorry. I felt like I was going to barf all afternoon. Well Im sorry I yelled at you like I did. I shouldnt have been so angry. After all it was just a pair of binoculars. In the big scheme of things thats really not so bad. (sniff) Really? Sure ... in another ten years youll probably be wrecking my CAR.
26/05/88
Hobbes look! Dad got me my own pair of little binoculars! Wow these are yours? Arent they great? Ill say. Dad said as long as I was going to break binoculars I ought to at least break my own. Now we can go to the beach and look at babes! Maybe I should break Dads power tools and see if I could get some of THOSE.
27/05/88
Wind wind wind RUMBLE RUMBLE POW! Either Im greatly deceived or someone opened a can of tuna in this vicinity. Yes ... all over this vicinity.
28/05/88
What a clear night! Look at all the stars. Millions of them! Yes were just tiny specks on a planet particle hurling through the infinite blackness. Lets go in and turn on all the lights.
29/05/88
Filth! Contamination! Pestilence! Ha ha ha! Of all living creatures few are more repulsive than Calvin the bug! He exists only to suck blood and transmit parasitic disease! Searching for someone to infect Calvin flies low over the picnic table! His sensitive antennae pick up the scent of human flesh! Touching down Calvin inserts his needlelike proboscis into a vein! Protozoans in his salive quickly induce plague! Will you stop that awful slurping?! Youre making me sick!
30/05/88
Dont move! Theres a bee on your back! There is? Showw it away! Quick! And have it come after ME? No thanks. Well what am I supposed to do? Stand like this all day? I guess you dont have much choice. Do you? Great. Just great. I could be here forever! Say that gives me an idea. Dont you go reading my comic books! Stay out of my room!

That rotten Hobbes! I cant move because Ive got a bee on my back so he goes to read all my comic books. He always gets them out of order and he folds the covers back! Ooh if I could only move! What kind of a friend would take advantage of a predicament like this? A lousy friend thats what kind! What a stinker he is! Hey did you see how the latest issue of Captain Napalm ended? Dont tell me! Dont tell me!
01/06/88
Hobbes if you tell me how my comic book ends Ill kill you. Ive waited all month to find out. Ill give you a hint OK? Captain Napalm takes his nuclear ... NO HINTS! NO HINTS! By golly you hairball if I didnt have a bee on my back right now Id ... Maybe theres a bee and maybe there isnt. ILL never tell. WHAT?! Is the bee gone? Can I move? Tell me! Is it still there?? Huh? Rrggh! Is it?!
02/06/88
Is the bee still on me or not? Im not telling. You called me a hairball. OK OK Im sorry. Youre not a hairball. Now is the bee there or not? No. Good. Now I ... OWW!! I meant No there IS a bee. Today is opposite day! Dont forget ... at midnight opposite day is over OK? Yes.
03/06/88
Im not having dinner tonight. Oh no? Nope. Im just going to eat cookies in front of the TV. You young man are going to sit at the table and eat what Ive fixed just like the rest of us. Oh yeah thats what I meant.
04/06/88
Hello Im wondering if you sell kegs of dynamite. You dont? How about plastic explosives? Youre kidding. Well what about land mines? Do you sell those? ... You dont? Look Im trying to send a girl I know into deep space. Perhaps you could suggest something.
05/06/88
FWOOSH As if life isnt short enough.
06/06/88
You know what we need Hobbes? We need an attitude. An attitude? Yeah. You cant be cool if you dont have an attitude. Really? Sure. Theyre all the rage. Now what kind of attitude could WE have? We could be courteously deferential. Oh good. Thats REAL cool.
07/06/88
Ive decided to be a fatalist. All events are preordained and unalterable. Whatever will be will be. That way if anything bad happens its not my fault. Its fate. TRIP WAUGH! Too bad you were fated to do that. THAT WASNT FATE!
08/06/88
Do you think grown-ups will have the world fixed up by the time they hand it over to us? Not the way theyre going. Thats what I thought. I guess that means its up to US then. Somehow Im not reassured. Ha! When Im president Ill have things whipped into shape in no time.
09/06/88
Either weve got to get a catcher or youve got to improve your pitching.
10/06/88
Gosh it sure looks like rain. Rain? What are you talking about? There isnt a cloud in the sky! You dont think it looks like rain? No. Go away and stop being silly.
11/06/88
OK out of the hammock. What do you mean? This isnt YOUR hammock. Its MY turn. I was here first. Its your turn when Im done. If you wont get out then Im coming in with you. Lick heck you are! This crummy hammock always sags.
12/06/88
Do you see any snapping turtles eels or leeches in there? Nope. So far our expedition is a failure. Hows the water? Absolutely frigid. My feet are completely numb. If I go in just a half inch every ten minutes I can stand it. Getting your swimsuit wet is the worst part though. As soon as it touches the water it soaks up and clings to you and gets you wet before youre ready. Why dont you just jump in and get it over with? Are you kidding? The shock would kill me! Its better to go in a wee bit at a time. No its better to do it all at once. Its worse to drag it out. You mustve been dropped when you were little. Ill show you! Look out! NO! NO! NO! SPLOOSH! Brr-r-r-r! Maybe you were right. WELL NEVER NOW NOW WILL WE?!?
13/06/88
Hey look! Mom and Dad are throwing duffel bags in the car. Theyre going on vacation! At last! Finally we get the house to ourselves! We can stay up late and watch TV! We can eat cookies for dinner! We ... What are you doing up here still? Cmon lets go. Me? Go? Where? On vacation! What have we been planning all month? With you and Mom?? What kind of vacation is THAT?!
14/06/88
So where are we going? I sure hope were not camping again this year? Well we are. Oh no! Why do we have to go camping?! I HATE camping! Swatting mosquitoes while lying frozen and cramped on bumpy rocks. With no TV and only canned food to eat is NOT my idea of a good time! Thats why we brought bug spray. Look just let me out here OK? Ill hitch home and see you when you get back all right?
15/06/88
Remember last year when it rained all week? It poured so hard we couldnt even make a fire. Without question that was one of the worst experiences of my life. Yes but it built character. Oh sure. Why cant I ever build character at a Miami condo or a casino somewhere?
16/06/88
Well here we are! Home away from home! OK Calvin. You get out with your Mom and Ill hand our gear to you. Now dont drop this. Its very ... oops. Dont worry Dad. Its only about ten feet deep. I can see that camera and everything. Im going to feed you to the sea gulls kid. Dear you came here to relax.
17/06/88
Gosh this waters cold! Here thats all I could find down there. Go get me a towel Calvin. It never fails. The one bag the kid dumps in the drink has all the fragile and perishable items in it. Well the week can only improve from here. One would like to THINK so. Hey Dad did you mean to stack the tackle box and all this on your glasses?
18/06/88
Boy dont go near Dad. What a grouch! I dont see why he cant be civil just because I accidentally dropped a duffel bag overboard and he broke his glasses. Are you going to tell him he left the car lights on back where we got the canoe? I think YOU should tell him.
19/06/88
Whats the score? Ten billion to one my favor. ITS NOT! Then keep track yourself. WHAP! Ha! It went straight up! Easy out! Easy out! Youre not even going to run eh? I dont blame you. Youre as good as out. Bink! YOU CANT DO THAT! Thats two hits in one pitch! This run counts double!
20/06/88
Hey Mom Dad and I are going fishing. Dont you want to come along? Uggh no. The last thing I want to see at this ungodly hour is a bunch of slimy fish gasping and flopping in the slop at the bottom of a boat. All ID like to see is a decent newspaper a fresh muffin and a pot of real coffee. Whyd we ever come HERE then? Go ask Conan the Barbarian. Cmon Calvin. Ill teach you to put a work on a hook.
21/06/88
Ahhh what a day! Up at dawn! Fresh air! Tranquility! No demands no phones no pressure! The whole day is ones own! Isnt this great? Isnt this the life? Spaceman Spiff a prisoner on the Zong slave galley plans his daring overboard escape! Ahh what a day!
22/06/88
Gosh I could look at the stars all night. Without the streetlights or pollution here it seems like you can see forever into space. SNAP CRUNCH Of course if youve seen one star youve seen them all. True true. Shall we mosey on the back to the tent?
23/06/88
Look Mom the water is up to my knees. See? See? Look Mom! The waters up to my knees. See? Look where the water is! Now look! The water is HIGHER than my knees! See? Look Mom! See? Im enthralled Calvin. YOURE NOT EVEN LOOKING!
24/06/88
Watcha doin Dad? Painting a picture? Yep. Whats that thing? A brontosaurus with rabies? Its that island over there. Oh. How far can you see without your glasses? Can you see ME? When I look up Id better not be able to.
25/06/88
Hi Mom! Mm. Dads painting a picture but its not coming out so hot and hes in a really stinky mood. Its like I asked him one little question and he nearly bit my head off! I mean its not as if I ruined his lousy picture right? Why should ... CALVIN CANT YOU SEE IM TRYING TO READ? Ever notice how tense grown-ups get when theyre recreating?
26/06/88
Si-i-i-i-ix ... fi-i-i-i-ive ... four-r-r-r ... threetwoone TAG! Youre it! THATS NOT FAIR! TAG! I GOTCHA! OK now Im it and I have to catch YOU. But what about a penalty? Dont you go to jail and do pushups first? No Im just it. There arent any penalties. None?? Dont I even get free hits? Free hits?! NO you dont get free hits! Just like on the arm? I think you should have to get hit on the arm. I dont have to get hit at ALL! Well what about an Indian burn then? Or noogies? Can I give you noogies? NO! IM JUST IT! THATS ALL THAT HAPPENS! OK OK! Thats all that happens. Sheesh. If you ask ME though any game without push-ups hits or noogies is a sissy game.
27/06/88
Theres nothing to DO here. Thats sort of the point dont you think? Its good to stop running around. Sometimes one should just look at things and think about things without DOING things. Youre certainly the expert on THAT. What I like is when youre looking and thinking and looking and thinking ... and suddenly you wake up.
28/06/88
Mom can Hobbes come in swimming with me? I dont think hed better Calvin. WHY NOT? Um ... tigers dont swim very well. They dont? Frankly Im not sure your Mom knows so much about tigers. Look we just want to avoid an argument right?
29/06/88
OK Calvin start packing up. Were going home. Now now. These little outings are valuable experience. Yeah? How? They give us a chance to be together as a family and learn about ourselves. Like how we cant stand being in such close proximity with one another this long? Exactly.
30/06/88
Z. Look at you. All you do is lie in the sun. I have to. How come? Tigers tummies are solar cells. Year right.
01/07/88
Are you hot? Not really why? It seems warm to me. Arent you a LITTLE hot? Nope. Not even a wee bit? Just a smidgen? What have you got behind your back?
02/07/88
SUSIE QUICK! GET HELP! Somebody filled my sandbox with quicksand! Im sinking fast! Ack! Rrghh! Oh right. Give me a break. Your gender would be a lot more tolerable if it wasnt so darn cynical.
03/07/88
Spaceman Spiff explores the outermost reaches of the universe. By popular request. Intrepid explorer Spaceman Spiff lands on an uncharted planet. What strange wonders will he discover here? Spiff sets out in search of sentient life! What a strange planet this is! Its surface is surpisingly soft and porous. And here curious geysers blast hot air! Suddenly it dawns on him! Spiff is not on the planets surface at all! Hes walking on a reclining alien!! Our hero sets his death ray blaster. Zz.. mmf hm?
04/07/88
This probably just goes to show something but I sure dont know what.
05/07/88
Theres quite a breeze up here. Im really moving. Theres the river and the town triangle. HEY DOWN THERE! My name is Calvin! Tell my tiger Hobbes Im blowing away on a balloon! CAN ANYONE HERE ME? TELL HOBBES HE CANT READ MY COMIC BOOKS JUST CAUSE IM NOT AROUND OK? ... OH YEAH TELL MY PARENTS WHAT HAPPENED TOO ALL RIGHT? HELLO? HELLO?
06/07/88
Uh oh Im heading into a flock of ducks. Excuse me! Coming through! Pardon me! Gangway! Beep beep! ... Boy if looks could kill.
07/07/88
My hands are getting tired. Ill tie the balloon string onto my belt loop. There ... WHOOP SHOOF If a plane comes along now Im going to die.
08/07/88
Well I suppose things dont get worse than hanging from a helium balloon a mile above some unrecognized state. Of course my grip could weaken or I could get sucked into a jet intake. Thats one of the remarkable things about life. Its never so bad that it cant get worse.
09/07/88
Boy Im just going higher and higher. I suppose eventually the pressure in the balloon will be greater than the air pressure around it and the balloon will ... POP!
10/07/88
Heres Hamster Huey and the Gooey Kablooie. You might like this story. Yeah? How good can it be if it hasnt been made into an animated TV show? I hope tonights story isnt as boring as LAST nights was. It put me right to sleep. Dont worry. THIS story will keep you up all night. Really? What is it? Its called The disembodied hand that strangled people. Gosh this is great! How creepy! I NEVER get a scary story! A disembodied hand! Wow! And now you know whats REALLY scary? They never found it! To this day nobody knows where the hand is. In fact the hand could ... OH NO! THERE IT IS! ITS G-GOT ME!! GAKK!! ... Calvin? ... Calvin? ... I shouldve thought of that years ago.
11/07/88
This has got to be a dream. Whenever you fall two miles up in the sky you look down gasp and suddenly wake up. GASP GASP GASP GASP GASP
12/07/88
I wonder if my life will flash before my eyes. Thats the problem with being six years old ... my life wont take very long to watch. Maybe I can get a few slow-motion replays of the time I smacked Susie upside the head with a slushball.
13/07/88
Say I wonder if I have any gum in my pocket. I could blow a big bubble and ... Nope. No gum. Lets try THIS pocket. MY TRANSMOGRIFIER GUN!! Boy these things come in handy all the time.
14/07/88
I forgot all about my transmogrifier gun! Now I have nothing to worry about! Ill just point it at myself and transmogrify! Im safe! ZAP
15/07/88
Where have you been?? Ive been calling and calling. Youre dinners cold Im sure. I drifted away on my balloon and it popped but fortunately I had my transmogrifier so after I mistakenly turned myself into a safe I transmogrified into a light particle and zipped back home instantaneously. ... Of course If Id known we were having THIS I wouldnt have hurried. Sometime you should try transmogrifying yourself into someone who occasionally makes an ounce of sense.
16/07/88
Calvin Id like you to pick up all the sticks and fallen branches in the yard so I can mow it. Will you pay me? Well ... OK Ill pay you a dollar. A dollar? I wont do it for less than twenty-five!! In a minute youll do it for nothing just because I told you to. ... Ill take the dollar. Smart kid.
17/07/88
I GOT A HIT! SAFE! OK that was a single. I have a ghost runner here now so I can bat again. And my ghost runners who were on first and second base are now on second and third right? Nope theyre both out. OUT? My ghost outfielder tagged your ghost going to third and thre to my ghost second baseman. It was a brilliant double play. THAT NEVER HAPPENED! Youve got two outs. Well my ghost on first just stole home so Ive got another run! Ha ha smarty! Yeah well all my outfield ghosts just ran in and beat the tobacco juice out of him. Ha! The ghost umpire just suspended all your ghosts for eternity. Theyre out of the game. Hmph! If my ghosts dont play I dont play. You forfeit the game then! You lose automatically if you quit! The ghost crowd supports me. Theyre boo-ing you! Sometimes I wish I lived in a neighborhood with more kids.
18/07/88
Lets go Calvin! Were all ready! Boy I havent been to the zoo in ages. And Calvins never been there. This will be fun. Ive been telling him about it all week. Hes so excited. CMON CALVIN! So WHERE do we have to go now? Beats ME. Mom and Dad are always dragging us to SOME dumb place.
19/07/88
How come alligators are in this big pit? So they dont get out and eat people. Does the zoo ever throw anyone in? Dont be silly. Of course not. How soon until we got hom?
20/07/88
Look! Monkeys! See how they use their tails and feet to climb? Zoos let people see how wild animals really behave. Hey look what THAT monkeys doing! Right in public too! Ha ha! Thats gross! How come IM not allowed to do that?! Come look at the birds over here Calvin.
21/07/88
What do you think of the zoo? I think its kind of depressing. I always feel sorry for the animals. They dont have much room to move or anything to do. They just sleep until theyre fed. Thats pretty much all YOU do. You know what I mean.
22/07/88
Hey those kids are feeding the animals! Mom can I get some peanuts to feed the animals? Im not your Mom. WHOOP Are you lost? What does your Mom look like? From the knees down she looks just like you.
23/07/88
Gosh I followed that lady halfway around the zoo thinking she was my Mom. Why dont Moms write their names on their calves so this kind of thing wouldnt happen? I wonder where I am. And wheres Hobbes? I thought he was right with me. Uh oh. Wheres Calvin? Why do these little family trips always turn out this way? Im going to spend more Saturdays at the office.
24/07/88
Rustle rustle zing! WHAM! We tigers just LIVE for that! Not for long you wont!
25/07/88
Heres Hobbes but wheres Calvin? I dont see him. Where could he have gone? We just turned our backs for a minute. And why didnt he take Hobbes? You stay here in case he comes back and Ill go look for him. OK. (sigh) Being a parent is wanting to hug and strangle your kid at the same time.
26/07/88
Sheesh. Calvin could be anywhere in this zoo. I hope he at least has the sense to stay put wherever he is. Where would the little rotter go if he was lost and separated from his stuffed toy? HIS NAME IS HOBBES AND HES ... HEY IM TALKING TO YOU!! TIGERS Panthera Tigris
27/07/88
I know! Maybe Calvint at the tiger pit since he likes tigers so much. Ha ha maybe Calvins IN the tiger pit since he likes tigers so much.
28/07/88
You found him! Thank goodness! Where was he? Looking at the tigers. I followed another lady thinking it was Mom and then when I realized I was lost I went to ask the tigers if theyd seen Hobbes. Next time you should ask a PERSON for help. ... Oh ... that never occurred to me. Only next time there wont BE a next time because were just going to tie you to a stake in the yard ever weekend. Dear! A fat lot of help your compatriots were I might add.
29/07/88
Do you know what day it is? Nope. Why? Oh no reason. I was just curious. I sure like summer vacation.
30/07/88
So you want some water huh? Well Ive got a big can of it here. Its up to ME to decide whether you get water or not! I control your fate! Your very LIVES are in my hands. Without ME youre as good as dead! Without ME you dont ...
31/07/88
Wow! How did you ever get so muddy? Well I was just standing there minding my own business when all of a sudden a horde of dirty cannibals comes ... forget it. Boy what a delightful afternoon. Sometimes I feel like I work all the time to afford this place and I never get to sit back with a good book and enjoy it. Well at least I have the weekends to ... CALVIN! YOU GOT MUD ALL OVER THE HOUSE! LOOK AT YOU! AIEE - THE COUCH! WHATD YOU DO?! DID YOU WALK ACROSS THE COUCH?! I DIDNT DO IT! SOMEONE ELSE MUST HAVE! I JUST SAW A MUDDY GUY GO RUNNING FROM ... OUT! OUT OF THE HOUSE NOW! OK OK! IM GOING! YOU DONT NEED TO PUSH! I CAN TELL WHEN IM NOT WANTED! HEY! LEGGO! OW! ALL RIGHT GOODBYE! Hey Dad catch the water balloon! Great reflexes Dad. By the way dont go in the house like that. Moms in one of her moods again. Ill bet I could get a lot of work done at office on weekends.
01/08/88
Mom? What Calvin? You know the living room couch? What about it? Dont you think its too wide? I was just ASKING!
02/08/88
Wind wind RUMBLE Oh no! POW! IT WASNT TUNA! IT WAS PINEAPPLE! SEE?! All cans sound the same.
03/08/88
The problem with having a tiger for a friend is that he always appears out of nowhere coming at you at 90 miles an hour! AAH! *Whew* I thought I heard him. ... Gosh my heart is still pounding. Where IS he?? Oh THERES Hobbes. Thank goodness. You havent been looking well Calvin. Maybe you should go to bed earlier.
04/08/88
Boy what a beautiful summer morning huh Dad? Too bad you cant stay home to enjoy it. When youre old youll be sorry you never took advantage of days like these but of course thats far off and in the meantime theres lots of work to be done. Yep youd better go to work have a good long drive in traffic. Maybe youll get home in time to watch the sun set ... if you can stay awake. So long! Golly Id hate to have a kid like me.
05/08/88
What would you do if I creamed you with this water balloon right now? Take the worst thing you can imaging and imagine something a hundred times worse than that. Youd do THAT? No Id do something even worse. He piqued my curiosity.
06/08/88
BIP WHEEEE.
07/08/88
The race will finish at that trr OK? This tree? Right. Readysetgo I win! On your mark ... get set ... Go! Hey! Leggo! OW! Stop that! MMF RRG PUFF PUFF FINISH! Oof. Ten minutes! Thats our best time yet for the 50-yard dash!
08/08/88
What are you doing with all your Dads tools in the bathroom? This faucet drips so Im going to fix it. YOURE going to fix it? Thats what I said. ... And you can keep your comments to yourself Dr Doom. I didnt say anything.
09/08/88
Fixing a faucet is easy. All you do is take it apart see whats leaking plug it up and put it back together. Does your Mom know youre doing this? Nope. Its going to be a surprise. And we all know how she loves surprises. I cant get this handle off. Pass me the hacksaw will you?
10/08/88
Arent you supposed to turn off the water before you take apart the faucet? Thats the problem Im trying to fix you moron! I cant turn the water off because the faucet leaks! Sheesh where were YOU when they were passing out brains? OH NO! AUGHH! ACKK! Ill get you some paper and carbons for your written apology.
11/08/88
Hobbes quick! How do you turn off the water?!? How should I know?? I cant put this piece back in with all this water coming out! Ill get your Mom! MY MOM? Have you lost your mind? She cant find out about this! Ill bet she notices when the kitchen ceiling starts to drip. Open the medicine cabinet! Find some cyanide!
12/08/88
La da dee dee da I think Ill get a bucket ... dum de doo ... Nothings wrong ... da dee doo ba ... I just want a bucket to hold some stuf. Ta tum ta tum. Lets see how many buckets do we have? Dum de doo. No cause for alarm. No need to panic ... I just want a few buckets. La la. YOUR turn.
13/08/88
Calvin what are you doing? Im ... uh ... going to the bathroom. Is everything all right? Fine! Dont come up! FLUSH
14/08/88
Dinosaurs everywhere flee for their lives! Calvin is coming. The late cretaceous: the last epoch of the mighty dinosaurs. King of the thunder lizards is the fearsome Calvin the tyrannosaurus! Seven tons of muscle and teeth he searches for his prey! Calvin for goodness sake stop stomping around! Youre driving me crazy! OW! CHOMP! How did the fearsome tyrannosaurus become extinct? Now we know!
15/08/88
Whats all that water I hear? Im coming in! Oh my gosh! ACKPBT! WHATS GOING ON?!? SPLUTB! BPLPTH! There! I got the water off. ALL RIGHT CALVIN WHERE ARE YOU?! H-hi Dad. Its the end of the world Calvin.
16/08/88
Look at this bathroom! What on earth were you DOING?! Nothing Dad! I was just here looking for some dental floss when PLOOIE! The faucet handle blows sky high all by itself! It ... it ... uh ... What I mean is Hobbes was fooling around with your tools. I tried to stop him but he wouldnt listen and sure enough he went and ... and ... One more try. Aliens Dad! Big evil bug-eyed monsters from Pluto! They did it and made me swear not to tell!
17/08/88
Boy Dad sure blew his stack THAT time didnt he?? What a sorehead! Listening to HIM youd think nobody in the world had ever needed to all a plumber before. Dads got a job. He can afford it. Dad makes such a big deal out of everything. When he does I sure wish youd stop trying to pin your crimes on ME. Oh now YOURE going to start on me TOO huh?
18/08/88
WAP Is this yours? No. What is it? For a girl shes remarkably perceptive.
19/08/88
No text.
20/08/88
Give me some cookies or I light the fuse and send us all to kingdom come. What did you do stick a piece of string into a hot dog? For heavent sake dont waste food Calvin. Give me that. Can I have any cookies? No. Go play outside. I sure wish I could get my hands on some REAL dynamite. Can I have the hot dog or did your Mom take it?
21/08/88
I brought a scary story out so were all set. Whats it called? The hideous monster who waits in your back yard to dismember you. Gosh this is the creepiest story Ive ever heard! Dont stop. Keep reading. Slowly the bog monster approached the innocent campers. Fangs glistening in the moonlight it ... What was that noise? Oh stop it. This is scary enough. No really. I heard something! Listen! SNAP! Its the bog monster! Oh no!! Oh no!! Quick turn out the flashlight! Lie still! CRUNCH CRACK Its coming this way! Were doomed! Its getting closer and closer! ZIPPPPP! Oh my gosh its... its opening the tent flap! Its coming in! AIEE! There it is! Blind it with the flashlight! Pull down the tent poles! Run Hobbes RUN! What are you doing in here?! Wheres your Dad? He just went out to check on you. The bog monster mustve got him! WHERES THAT KID?!
22/08/88
Everything floats randomly in the romm! Theres no gravity! Calvin pushes off the ceiling at a sharp angle aiming for the hallway! He glides with unchecked momentum turning himself to be able to push off the next stationary surface. Cmon you! Outside! Youre really bouncing off the walls today. Aw Mom!
23/08/88
Extra pants... Three shirts two seaters two sweatshirts... Another pair of pants... Still trying to learn to ride that bicycle eh? I dont need any comments from you.
24/08/88
A shadow falls over the large city skyscrapers! Its a gigantic ant! With one footstep it pulverizes the entire downtown! Millions die instantly! The ant brushes the city off the map! People flood the streets in panic only to be smashed in the horrible wreckage! Well... maybe I wont...
25/08/88
What are you doing Susie? Drawing on the sidewalk. Wow! Can I too? Sure. Heres some chalk. Gosh Ive never been a vandal before! This isnt vandalism. It washes right off!
26/08/88
OK I feel one coming. Are you ready? Ready. ACHOOO POOF Did you get it? Yep! See here it comes. Boy thats a good one! Why cant my school portraits ever look like this?
27/08/88
Dont come in here! Why not? Im roasting. Youll get hair in the water. Go do something else. HEY! Stop that! HEY! HEY! You think youve won huh? Well Im not even going to TELL you what I did. ACKPTH!
28/08/88
Well summer is almost over it sure went quick didnt it? Yep. Theres never enough time to do all the nothing you want.
29/08/88
TRIP BAP WHACK BAP
30/08/88
Im hungry. Too bad. Breakfast isnt until tomorrow. My tummys growling. Hush. Most people dont sleep well next to a hungry tiger. Sometimes I sure wish I had a dog. More tuna and less mayonnaise.
31/08/88
Oh no! Theres a tyrannosaurus in the grocery store! The dinosaur heads for the meat department and devours the butcher! Shoppers everywhere flee for their lives! Its mayhem destruction and carnage in the aisles! Oh no! Calvin cant I take you ANYWHERE?! Now the tyrannosaurus wants cookies!
01/09/88
Planet Calvin moves across the solar system. Nobody notices until his orbit takes him directly between the sun and earth. Calvin causes a total solar eclipse! Earch is shrouded in darknes. How long will Calvin stay there? Could you move please? Youre in my light. HA HA HAAA!
02/09/88
Election day is coming up. Have you decided on a running mate? Sure. You cant be elected Dad without a MOM right? Are you going to keep the Mom Ive had or get a NEW running mate? Gee... Bedtime Calvin. Of course Ill stick with your Mom. Aww.
03/09/88
I think rituals are important. MY favorite ritual is eating three bowls of chocolate frosted sugar bombs and watching TV cartoons all Saturday morning. After a few hourse Im so overstimulated I cant sit still or even think straight. Sort of a transcendental experience huh? Yeah. I achieve a lower consciousness.
04/09/88
Can I have a different plate Mom? Why? Somebody puked on mine. Just eat your dinner and keep quiet OK Calvin? EWWWW MMF! HOOPA ARGH! FLIP FLOP BLAHHHHHHH TWITCH TWITCH Oh knock it off Calvin its hamburger casserole. Theres not a thing in there you dont like. This is HAMBURGER? Chew Chew Hmm... This bit wasnt so bad for some reason. I was able to choke it down anyway. My stomach is still cramping up but the pains arent as sharp any more. The secret is to suppress the gag reflex. After I swallow it I can stand it. Good Im glad this is such a hit.
05/09/88
All right all right! Im GOING! Hey! Leggo! I can walk myself! I just have to... OK! Look Im going! Im going! Sure you think schools great NOW. But in a couple of hourse youll MISS me! Youll see!
06/09/88
There goes Calvin off to school. He sure put up a fuss. Well hell have fun once he gets there. See hes even running now. Hes all excited about... HEY! CALVIN. THE BUS STOP IS THAT WAY! COME BACK HERE!
07/09/88
I cant believe Im here waiting to go to school. What happened to summer? Gosh I couldnt WAIT for today! Soon well be making new friends learning all sorts of important things and... Whats the matter with YOU?? Your bangs do a good job of covering up the lobotomy stitches.
08/09/88
I pledge allegiance... to Queen Fragg... and her mighty state of hysteria... Its going to be a long year.
09/09/88
Hey Calvin youre on my swing. Get lost. Im not scared of you Moe. Oh no? Nope. Youre so dumb you probably never thought about how a sparrows smaller size and maneuverability is an advantage in fighting off big crows. Yeah? Those TV nature programs will be the death of me yet.
10/09/88
Yes Calvin? May I be excused please? Again? I have to go. Bad. All right. Thank you. What are YOU doing home?! I had to go.
11/09/88
So THERE you are! Get out right now! Into the tub! Lets go!! Shed never have found me if I hadnt sneezed. Ill give you a quarter to take my bath for me. Lets see the quarter first. Here. Just splash around while I make sounds as if its me in the tub. OK its a deal. In fact for another 25 cents Ill take your Wednesday batch too. Wow! Really? I could never take a bath again! La de da da dum dum Im washing my arms now! Whoops! Dropped the soap! Now Im washing my face! OK you can come out now. Thats long enough. Boy that was easy. A few weeks of this and Ill be rich! Not so long with the drier. Mom will get suspicious. Im not all dry yet. There! We made it. Now keep a straight face. Good night. Give me a kiss. BLECHH! Youre filty. Didnt you hear me take a batch?? See? My towel is wet! See? See? I want my quarter back. Forget it. Its as good as spent.
12/09/88
Have you been reading the papers? Grown-ups really have the world fouled up. Acid rain toxic wastes holes in the ozone sewage in the oceans and on and on! The only bright side to all this is that eventually there may not be a piece of the planet worth fighting over.
13/09/88
Youre packing? Yep. Get your toothbrush Hobbes were outta here. Its an outrage how grown-ups have polluted the earth! I refuse to inherit a spoiled plant! Im LEAVING! Really? Where to?? You know sometimes youre a real load to have around. I was just ASKING!
14/09/88
How about Mars? We could go there to avoid Earths pollution. Yeah! If we go NOW we can claim it and keep everyone else off it. OK its settled. Mars it is. You finish packing. Ill go get the wagon. Were going in the wagon? Of course! What did YOU want to do? Flap your arms? I guess I hadnt thought about that part. Obviously.
15/09/88
So long Mom. Hobbes and I are going to Mars to live. Earth is too polluted. Have a good time. Say goodbye to Dad for us. If I can find an interplanetary post offce Ill write to you once in a while and ... Calvin dont stand there with the door open. Youre letting in the bugs. Either stay in or go outside. She didnt seem to choked up about us going did she? We shouldve left a long time ago.
16/09/88
BLAST OFF! Do you really think well get enough lift to break Earths gravity? Of course! You think I didnt plan this out?! I thought of everything. Did you think of what youll eat on our trip? Packing was YOUR job! Didnt you pack us any FOOD?? I packed food for ME...
17/09/88
We did it! We cleared Earths orbit! Mars here we come! Are you sure this is the way? What? You didnt bring the map?!
18/09/88
Call it. Tails. OK best two out of three. OOOMPH Lets change this to TOUCH football OK?
19/09/88
Space travel makes you realize just how small we really are. When you see Earth as a tiny blue speck in the infinite reaches of space you have to wonder about the mysteries of creation. Surely were all part of some great design no more or less important than anything else in the Universe. Surely everything fits together and has a purpose a reason for being. Doesnt it make you wonder? I wonder what happens if you throw up in zero gravity. Maybe you should wonder what its like to walk home.
20/09/88
Hang on! Were coming in through Mars atmosphere. BONK BONK Weve landed! Were the first ones to ever set foot on another planet! What a historic moment! I still cant believe you forgot the camera. I remembered it. YOU just didnt want to turn around.
21/09/88
See any signs of Martian life? Not yet... Hey look! Its the old Viking spacecraft that landed here in the 70s. Gosh I wonder if its still working. BLAHHHH HOOP HOOP BOOLA BOOLA ACKACKACK That ought to blow some circuits at NASA! Hee Hee Hee! Ive always wanted to do something like that.
22/09/88
Well this is our new home. I guess we should unpack and set up camp. Comic books... comic books... tuna... some candy bars... more tuna... toothbrushes... a can opener... looks like were all set. Whats this? A night light. I thought it might be scary sleeping on a new planet. Boy you thought of everything. Now we have to find an outlet.
23/09/88
Yep Mars may be a little dull but its better than earth. CRUNCH CRUCH Weve got a whole planet to ourselves. Brand new and unspoiled. No people. No pollution. Nothing but rugget natural beauty as far as the eye can see. Thats not your candy bar wrapper over there is it? It was just there a minute! I wasnt going to leave it.
24/09/88
I dont know about you but I LIKE it here on Mars. I do too. Its very peaceful. Not only that but we dont have MOM here to boss us around! No early bedtime no baths no disgusting dinners no... Did that rock just move?? MOMMMMM!!
25/09/88
You know what would make this house a lot better? No what? You should take out the stairs and put me in an elevator. Good. Ill file that with your idea for a moving sidewalk. Oh no! WHOAAA OWW ... WWCH! WHOAAA OWW ... WWCH! WHOAAA OWW ... WWCH! Did you fall down the stairs AGAIN?! Thats me. (Oof) the human slinky.
26/09/88
Oh my gosh that rock moved! Theres something under it! It must be a Martian! Oh no! Oh no! Its probably some creepy tentacled bug-eyed monster! Youre right! Theres a tentacle now! Its coming out! What will we do?! AAUGHHHHH
27/09/88
Is the Martian still out there? Ill take a peek. I dont see him. He must have hidden. Hidden?? Do you think hes scared of us? Why not? WERE scared of HIM. Yeah but WERE just ordinary earthlings not weirdos from another planet like HE is.
28/09/88
Why do you think the Martian hid from us? Maybe Martians dont like Earthlings. Dont like us?! Whats not to like?? Theres nothing wrong with humans! Hey you Martian! Come on out! Were not bad! We just came here because our people polluted our own planet so much that ... uh... what I mean is... um... So what are you saying? That our reputation has preceded us? Would you welcome in a dog that wasnt house-trained?
29/09/88
I guess we should go home to Earth. Yeah we may not be welcome here. We ought to fix up our own planet before we go messing around with other peoples planets. After all theres only one Earth and its got to last us a while. We also should go home because were clean out of tuna. I hope Mom and Dad didnt rent out my room.
30/09/88
Theres Earth. Were almost home. Look you can see the continents. Hmm... if I remember my atlas we live in a big purple country. And our house is by the giant letter E in the word States.
01/10/88
Hi Dad! Guess what Hobbes and I did! We went to Mars! Well well. Yep. We were going to live there because Earth is so polluted but we discovered that Mars is inhabited so we came back home. You didnt like the Martians? No they didnt like US. I think they were afraid wed junk up Mars the way weve junked up Earth. Whats my good briefcase doing out and why does it smell like tuna fish?! And can you believe it Dad? We go clear to Mars and dumb ol Hobbes forgets the camera!
02/10/88
Uh-oh. Something is very wrong here. Calvin has mysteriously shrunk to a quarter of an inch tall! How can he make his plight known to his parents when he is smaller than a penny? Calvin gets an idea! He grabs the leg of a passing housefly and flies to his Dads camera! Once there he climbs up and sets the self-timer. Jumping on the shutter Calvin has 15 short seconds to get in front of the lens. With luck Calvins Dad will have the film developed soon and discover what has happened. What happened?! Look at all these terrible pictures! I dont remember taking these. Whos that little speck in the distance all the time? You havent been fooling with my camera have you? ME? Heck no. Maybe you should get the camera fixed.
03/10/88
For show and tell I have brought a space alien I captured in my back yard. Yes for the last two days Ive been keeping it in this special zarnium-coated bag and feeding it pure ammonia! And now the moment youve all been waiting for! AARGH Howd it work? My teacher says Mom and Dad both have to sign my report cards this year.
04/10/88
SCOOTCH SCOOTCH GREETINGS. I AM X-387 ROBOT PROBE SENT FROM JUPITER. Mm hmm. MY SENSORS INDICATE TRACE AMOUNTS OF CHOCOLATE IN THE PANTRY. PLEASE LOAD SOME IN MY SCOOP FOR ANALYSIS. No youll spoil your appetite. MY MISSION MUST NOT FAIL. PREPARE FOR ANNIHILATION PITIFUL EARTH FEMALE. Go back to Jupiter X-3 whatever.
05/10/88
You know when you think about it our lives are pretty nice. A lot of kids dont have as good of a home life as we do. We really cant complain. ... which isnt to say we should go home yet. When do you think theyll see the car windshield?
06/10/88
Hi Susie! Guess what I brought for lunch. No! Go sit by someone else OK? You always say your lunch is something revolting and I dont want to hear it! Gee whiz whats wrong with you? My lunch is peanut butter. Whats so disgusting about that?! Hmph. Im glad that one day out of the year you can be civil. Its my DESSERT thats gross! Look a thermos full of phlegm!
07/10/88
Calvin will you run and get my purse please? I need the calculator. Sure. Here you are. Thanks. Ahem. IM NOT GOING TO TIP YOU!! Huh! See if I ever fetch anything again.
08/10/88
Election day is coming up Dad. People want to know where you stand on the issues. Such as? Later bedtimes expanded TV privileges shorter school weeks and less discipline. Im against them all. Hows your IRA? Pretty well funded? Go to bed.
09/10/88
My parents are the two stupidest people on earth. Just my luck theyd get married and have me. I hate everybody. I dont see home anyone could ever fall in love. People are jerks. Sometimes they are but look at the colors on the trees today. Yeah? So what? I think its more fun to see something like this WITH someone than just by yourself. I GUESSSS so... but Id still rather see this with a tiger than a person. Well THAT goes without saying.
10/10/88
MOMMMM Whats the matter Calvin? I dont feel good. What hurts? My stomach. I want Mom. ME? Whats wrong with YOU for crying out loud?!? You can ask him. Now let me get back under the covers.
11/10/88
Sheesh its two in the morning. Why do kids always have to feel sick at two in the morning? Calvin probably just ate too much dessert. If hes going to get me up at this hour hed better REALLY be sick. BARRRFF I DIDNT MEAN IT! Honey pipe down. Im trying to sleep.
12/10/88
Its been 20 minutes since youve been sick so lets take your temparature. Ig gomfa fome ubhiggin. Whatd you say honey? IG GOMFA FOME UBHIGGIN. AACK! WHY DIDNT YOU SAY SO? Give me the thermometer! Run! Run!
13/10/88
I think the worst of this is over so just try to get some sleep. Im going back to bed but give me a call if you feel sick again OK? Now get some rest. Mm hmm. Poor little kid. YECHHH! There is nothing worse than a sick roommate! Face THAT way!
14/10/88
Its scary being sick... especially at night. What if something is REALLY wrong with me and I have to go to the hospital?? What if they stick me full of tubes and hoses? What if they have to operate? What if the operation fails? What if this is my... my... last night... ALIVE?? Then I can look forward to having the bed to myself tomorrow. Few things are less comforting than a tiger whos up too late.
15/10/88
Feel any better this morning Calvin? No. I guess Id better make you an appointment with the doctor. OK. Its Saturday by the way. You wont miss school. I know.
16/10/88
The valiant Spaceman Spiff energetic inter-galactic explorer comes in over the mountains of a strange planet! Our hero desperately hopes to find a rest area with working facilities. Spaceman Spiff lands on the distant planet Zokk. Climbing down from his spacevraft our hero prepares to explore te surface! Unexpectedy Spiffs first step sends him careening through the sky! Spiff quickly realizes that Planet Zokk has only a fraction of Earths gravity. With practice our hero soon finds he can bound effortlessly across the landscape. Stop bouncing on the bed and go to sleep.
17/10/88
Well it looks like Calvin just caught the bug going around. Nothing serious. Keep an eye on him and let me know if he isnt feeling better soon. OK. Thank you. So long Calvin. You were a good patient this time. Mm. Nothing like a little virus to take the edge off a kid. Id still rather let his teacher deal with him.
18/10/88
I get to stay home from school today. I get to lie in bed drink tea and read comic books all day. I wish I could do this every day. ... like some people I know. Your Mom doesnt bring ME tea in bed.
19/10/88
I want some more toast. ROOM SERVICE!! Ha! THAT sure got you up here quick! Tomorrow youre going to school.
20/10/88
I think people worry too much about little things. All they do is make themselves unhappy that way. Why get an ulcer over things that dont really matter? Like the book report youre supposed to be writing now on the book you havent read? Exactly. Case in point.
21/10/88
Why in the world am I waiting in the pouring rain for the school bus to take me somewhere I dont even want to go? I go to school but I never learn what I want to know.
22/10/88
I hate school. Each day I count the hours until schools over. Then I count the days until the weekend. Then I count the weeks until the month is over and then the months until summer. I always have to postpone what I WANT to do for what I HAVE to do! Welcome to the world. Would you sign this parental excuse to get me out of the next 11 1/2 years of school?
23/10/88
I feel a big sneeze welling up. ... which is always a sure sign that Im not carrying a handkerchief. Ah... Ah... Ah... CHOOOOO!! Mom I sneezed and blew my head off! Pull your shirt down Calvin. Youre not fooling anyone. Mom would be a lot more fun if she was a little more gullible.
24/10/88
Dumb balloon. Poof poof poof poof poof
25/10/88
Hey Susie did you have any trouble with our math homework last night? No why? I thought a couple of these were tricky. Can I check my answers with yours? OK. Thanks. What did you get for questions one? Seven. Seven? Good thats what I got. What did you get for question two? DROP DEAD CALVIN.
26/10/88
Ever sit and watch ants? Look at this one. Hes carrying a crumb thats bigger than he is and hes RUNNING. And if you put an obstacle in front of him hell scramble like crazy until he gets across it. He doesnt let anything stop him. I just cant identify with that kind of work ethic.
27/10/88
Just think Earth was a cloud of dust 4.5 billion years ago... 3 billion years ago the first bacteria appeared. Then came sea life dinosaurs birds mammals and finally a million years ago man. Now in 1988 theres me. ... the acme of evolution. Oh PLEASE.
28/10/88
Its not quite the same is it? And it probably wont snow for another month at least.
29/10/88
Z Z GRRR Z GROWLL RRR! Psst! Hey! Wake up! Youre dreaming! Grrrr... And Mom wonders why I never look rested in the morning.
30/10/88
So THERE you are! Get out right now! Into the tub! Lets go!! Shed never have found me if I hadnt sneezed. Ill give you a quarter to take my bath for me. Lets see the quarter first. Here. Just splash around while I make sounds as if its me in the tub
31/10/88
Look! A buckeye! Isnt it pretty? Look how perfect it is. Im going to keep this one. What will you do with it? Try to dent Susies skull from 50 feet.
01/11/88
What are you doing? Dad told me to go outside so Im digging a hole to China. If Dads going to be such a grouch I figure Ill just go live on the other side of the planet. You can come too if you want. Theres another shovel in the garage. You dont think your DAD will get mad about us digging up the driveway? Oh you know Dad. Hell get mad no matter WHERE we dig.
02/11/88
Look what Mom made me! A super hero outfit. Dont I look cool? Now I can fight crime without anyone knowing my true identity! Yep Im all set now! ... So! Seen any crimes? Why do you care that nobody knows your identity?
03/11/88
Calvin take off your outfit before you sit at the table OK? Calvin? Whos Calvin? Im Stupendous Man! Stop being silly. And do as I asked you. But Mom I NEED to wear this for dinner! No you dont. Lets go. But Stupendous Man has a stomach of steel!
04/11/88
Mom said I cant go outside until I finish my homework. If youll help me Ill be faster. Whats five plus seven? I dont know. I dont either. Then write I dont know. Hey thats a true answer isnt it! I can write that for ALL of these! Were done! Wed better have a look at our prodigys homework.
05/11/88
Want to go play outside? No. Im watching TV. You hate this show. Lets go out. Nah. Why not? Dad said he was sick of arguing with me and for all he cared I could watch TV until my brains oozed out of my ears. So youre going to? It was a hard-won privilege.
06/11/88
Flaps ... check. Fuel ... check. Landing gear ... check. Goggles... check. Calvin pilots his F-15 at more than 1500 miles per hour. Loaded with tons of every conceivable missile weapon the jet shrieks low over the ground. Up and over the next rise his target comes into view. Calvin FIRES! FWISSHHH! Missile after missile streaks ahead and detonates with grim accuracy! PFOOM! Mission accomplished! A smoldering crater is all that remains of Calvins elementary school! ... sigh...
07/11/88
Well Dad were right down to the wire and the polls say you wont be Dad here much longer. It seems youre just not likeable enough. Those polled continue to find you a cold fish. If you want some advice I suggest you do something extraordinarily likeable in the next two minutes. Go to bed. No no! Its WAY too late to learn how to tell jokes.
08/11/88
Ten... Fifteen... Six... Twenty-two... HIKE! YAAAA AUGH! Another five yeard loss! Weve got to get some other players.
09/11/88
Boy youre lucky YOU dont have to go to school like I do. You dont know what its like to get up on these cold dark mornings and have to go someplace you hate. Yes I do. Oh yeah? How could you? You tell me every morning. Oh am I keeping you awake?! Im SORRY!
10/11/88
Hey! This (mmf) isnt (ooch) how you play the game! You still havent tackled me!
11/11/88
Off the swing Twinky. Forget it Moe. I just got on. You have to wait your turn like everyone else. I said Off. I keep forgetting that rules are only for little nice people.
12/11/88
HIKE! Whoops! Heh heh... Im losing the game but winning an ambulatory adulthood.
13/11/88
RINGGG What a day. KAPOW You think thats funny? Come back here and fight you weasel! What happened to YOU?? Dont ask. Im going upstairs to change. NOT AGAAINN! Wheres Calvin? I sent him to his room. I caught him making prank calls to pet stores asking if theyd buy his tiger.
14/11/88
Hey Susie can I borrow your black crayon? OK but dont break it. And dont peel the paper off and color with all sides of it so it stays pointy. Geez why dont you take out an insurance policy on it? Just dont ruin my crayon. What are you drawing anyway? Black bears attacking a black forest campground at midnight. Give me my crayon back.
15/11/88
Hey! Whats this stuff in my soup?! Yecchh! Is this rice?!? It had better NOT be! Rice? Let me see. Look! These little white things! See theres rice in my soup! I hate rice! I didnt put any rice in. These are maggots. EWWWW!! Another lovely meal at home with my family... I wish my job required more travel. Well hes EATING it now right? Gosh wait til I tell everyone at school what WE had for dinner!
16/11/88
Uh oh. HOOP EEP! Ive god the hiccups something terrible Mom. Drink some water.
17/11/88
BANG! I gotcha! ARGG! GAACKK UGHH! Here. Whats this? Its your death rattle!
18/11/88
It must be awful to be a girl. Im sure its frustrating knowing that men are bigger stronger and better at abstract thought than women. Really if youre a girl what would make you go on living? The thought of a jerk like you begging one of us for a date when youre 17. Ha! Not ME! Gross!
19/11/88
The tyrannosaurus stalks the cretaceous shores. The 5-ton carnovorous lizard can run faster than a charging rhino! What could be more horrifying? STOP THAT CLOMPING AROUND!! ... besides the blood-curdling roar of its Mom...
20/11/88
Ive never liked crayons very much. They just dont have any flavor at all. For an art project Im supposed to draw my pet but since I dont have one Ill draw you. OK! Look ferocious. Hows this? Thats great. Hold still now. Hmm... mm... ARRGH! This isnt coming out good at all! I cant draw tigers! I hate this class! Here let me try. The good things about drawing a tiger is that it automatically makes your picture fine art. Hey thats pretty good. Put some human heads around him as if he just ate a village. Hows that? Boy this is great! Ill have the best picture in the whole class! I cant wait to show everyone! Wow! Thanks Hobbes! But Im NOT lying! My TIGER drew it! Do you think I could draw something that good MYSELF?? Yes...
21/11/88
When I grow up I want to be an inventor. First I will invent a time machine. Then Ill come back yesterday and take myself to tomorrow and skip this dumb assignment.
22/11/88
MOMMM IM HOME FROM SCHOOL! OPEN THE DOOR FOR ME OK? Whats the matter? It wasnt locked. Sometimes Hobbes is waiting to pounce on me as soon as I open the door. Oh for heavens sake! From now on dont call me to come to the door unless its locked. Ha! I sure out-smarted Hobbes THIS time! THBBPTT! Sissy.
23/11/88
Boy Im in a bad mood today! Everyone had better steer clear of me! I hate EVERYBODY! As far as Im concerned everyone on the planet can just drop dead. People are scum. WELL-L-L? DOESNT ANYONE WANT TO CHEER ME UP?!?
24/11/88
Get out of my way! Im in a bad mood. Ill bet a pet dog wouldve gotten out of my way.
25/11/88
Watch out Mom. Im in a bad mood. Be in a bad mood somewhere else OK? Im busy. Hmph! Ill bet my biological mother wouldve bought me a comic booka nd made me feel better instead of shunning me like YOU. Kid anyone BUT your biological mother wouldve left you to the wolves long ago. Yeah right. Really how much did you pay for me?
26/11/88
Wahts your tail for? My tail? Yeah why do tigers need tails? Gee Im not really sure. I guess just because they look good. So its sort of a necktie for your butt? Lets not be vulgar. Youre just jealous.
27/11/88
If I was in charge wed never see grass between October and May. On THREE ready? One... two... three! SNOW! I SAID SNOW! CMON! SNOW! SNOW! OK then dont snow! See what I care! I LIKE this weather! Lets have it forever! PLEEAASE snow! Please?? Just a foot! Ok eight inches! Thats all! Cmon! Six inches even! How about just six?? IM WAAIITING... RRRRGGHHH DO YOU WANT ME TO BECOME AN ATHEIST?
28/11/88
WHO MADE THIS MESS OUT HERE?! It wasnt ME Mom it was... uh... it was... it was a horrible little venusian who materialized in the kitchen! He took out some diabolical high-frequency device pointed it at various objects and... mothers are the necessity of invention.
29/11/88
IM HO-OME! KAPOW What did you do step on a land mine? Whens Dad ever going to build that tiger pit I keep asking him about?
30/11/88
Calvin where are you? Get out here! Come on Calvin Im getting tired of this. I MEAN it Calvin! Come out and take your bath! NOW! Sooner or later shes going to have to question whether this is really worth the trouble.
01/12/88
I wish it would snow eight feet in the next five minutes so theyd have to close school. Cmon snow! Snow snow snow snow snow snow snow snow! So close... and yet so far.
02/12/88
You think God lets you plea bargain? Id worry more about your Mom.
03/12/88
Hello? Hi Dad! Its me Calvin. Will you tell me a story? Calvin Im at work! I dont have time to tell you a story now. Im very busy! Get off the phone. Im expecting important calls. OK Dad. Ill just stay here quietly growing up at an unbelievable rate never spending much special time with my own Dad whos always working. Right right. This is the story of the hydraulic pump (Fig. 1) the wheel shaft flange (Fig. 2) and the evil patent infringement. I want a GOOD story.
04/12/88
Who is this mysterious masked man?? KAPWINGG! And why has he never been photographed together with handsome 6-year-old millionaire playboy Calvin? A solitary caped figure runs across the moonlit building top! A crimson bolt blasts across the night sky striking fear into the hearts of all evildoers! Yes its STUPENDOUS MAN champion of liberty defender of free will! Some diabolical fiend threatens to establish a totalitarian system of rule! Only STUPENDOUS MAN can save the day! Aha! Just as I suspected! My evil archnemesis MOM-LADY! Didnt I tell you to go to bed?!? Oh no! Stupendous Mans stupendous powers are no match against his adversary! Stupendous Man is vanquished! This would have been plenty humiliating WITHOUT the goodnight kiss. And take off that silly hood before you smother over in your sleep.
05/12/88
Spiffs spacecraft is immobilized! The navigatron has shorted out! A zillion miles from any planet our hero must climb out and fix it himself in zero gravity! Upside down Spiff clings tightly to his spaceship! One slip will send him hurling into the horrors of the infinite beyond! GO... TO... SCHOOL! NO!
06/12/88
I dont understand how Santa runs his operation. How can he afford to give toys away? How does he pay for the raw materials he uses to make the toys? How does he pay his elves? Theres no income to cover his costs. How does he do it? Deficit spending I guess. Sure but sooner or later its going to catch up to him and then where will I be?!
07/12/88
Dear Santa Hi its me Calvin. This year Ive been extra good so PBTBT!! MMF MMF EEP! Perhaps you need a drink of water. I think I do.
08/12/88
Want to read my letter to Santa? All THAT?! I hope I didnt forget to ask for something I want. This is alphabetized. Yeah and I cross-indexed the accessory items hell need to get. I try to help him out. This says Volume One. Atom Bomb through Grenade Launcher. Youre going to be one sad little kid on Christmas morning.
09/12/88
It snowed last night! Turn on the radio! Maybe they closed school! Maybe the school buses all froze up! Maybe the principal cant get out of his driveway! Get dressed Calvin. It only snowed an inch. Getting an inch of snow is like winning 10 cents in the lottery.
10/12/88
A lone knight charges up the hill towards the giant cave at the top. Immediately the monstrous dragon lunges out and spews a raging fireball! The knight is fried to a crunchy crips... his armor fused into a solid piece! The dragon cricles overhead daring other fools to come after him! Did you brush your teeth? Come here and see!
11/12/88
Here we are at the top of Dismemberment Gorge. Ready to go down? How about if I steer this time? Get on you big sissy. Ive been good all day so far. Christmas is getting near huh? You got it. Ive been wondering though. Is it truly being good if the only reason I behave well is so I can get more loot at Christmas? I mean really all Im doing is saying I can be bribed. Is that good enough or do I have to be good in my heart and spirit? In other words do I really have to BE good or do I have to ACT good? I suppose in YOUR case Santa will have to take what he can get. OK... so exactly how good do you think I have to act? REALLY good or just PRETTY good?
12/12/88
Im gonna pound you in gym class shrimp. Get your kicks now you glandular freak because once you grow up you cant go beating people up for no reason. Yeah I guess youre right. That really wasnt what I meant at all.
13/12/88
What grade did you get? I got an A. Really? Boy Id hate to be you. I got a C. Why on earth would you rather get a C than an A?! I find my life is a lot easier the lower I keep everyones expectations.
14/12/88
Why do I have to wear these dorky clothes and get my hair combed?! Your Dads going to take your picture. Hold still. I dont WANT to get my picture taken! It will just a few minutes. Were going to put the pictur eof you in our Christmas cards so everyone can see what you look like now. What a dumb idea. Why are we doing that? So we wont have relatives dropping by to visit. DEAR...
15/12/88
Ready? OK give me a nice smile. Thats good. One... two... three! CLICK My hairs getting messed up Dad!
16/12/88
I dont have much film left so stop making faces when I take the picture or your names mud. You couldve been done 20 minutes ago if youd just cooperated. Now give me a smile and hold it for two seconds. CLICK CALVIN! THAT WAS A SMILE! I SMILED!
17/12/88
We cant send these in our Christmas cards. People will think its sacrilegeous. Well these DO look like Calvin... except for the combed hair.

Ahh... the perfect slushball! Hard enough to sting yet sloppy enough to dribble down the collar and soak the undergarments. Here comes Susie. Nows my chance to hit her with the slushball! I see you! Youd better not throw that! Santa Claus is watching you right now! ZINGG FWISSHHH! WHAP! Oh yes! YES! It was worth it! What a shot! Im not sorry! Oh it was beautiful! Id do it again in a minute! Ha ha! Santas gonna skip this block for years.
19/12/88
Do you think monsters are under the bed tonight? I dont know. How can you tell without looking? One way is to tell a story about a little kid getting mauled and eaten alive. How does THAT tell you of you have monsters? Sometimes they laugh.
20/12/88
Im freezing! Why do we keep this house so darn cold?! Crank up the thermostat and build a fire will ya? I have a better idea. Cmere. OK step outside. Why? Whats outside? In a few minutes you can come in and then the house will seem nice and warm. Im telling the newspapers about you Dad!
21/12/88
Read me Hamster Huey and the Gooey Kablooie. Oh I dont want to read that again. Lets read something different tonight. No I want to hear Hamster Huey and the Gooey Kablooie. Cmon Calvin Ive read this a thousand times. Read it again. Please? PLEASE? All right all right. Youll do the squeky voices the gooshy sound effects and the happy hamster hop wont you? Look cant we read something else?
22/12/88
MOMM! MOM! What is it? Whats the matter? Do people grow from spores? SPORES?!? You wake me up at 2 am to ask if people grow from spores? Are you out of your mind?? Why are you even awake?! Go to sleep!! She didnt answer. She must not know. Im telling you its true.
23/12/88
I say its a fallacy that kids need 12 years of school! Three months is plenty! Look at me. Im smart! I dont need 11 1/2 more years of school! Its a complete waste of my time! How on earth did you get all the way to the bust stop with both feet through one pant leg? I fell down a lot. ...Why? Whats your point? Nothing. I was just curious.
24/12/88
Hows my peanut butter sandwich coming? Youre using chunky peanut butter right? I wont eat smooth! Make it an open face sandwich too! Dont put any jelly on it or anything! And use some normal bread! I dont like those weird grain breads! Did you cut it diagonally? I like triangles better than rectangles so be sure to cut it right! Your majestys sandwich. HEY this is a closed-face horizontally cut smooth peanut butter sandwich on weird bread with jelly! Werent you LISTENING?!
25/12/88
Im leaving out a sandwich for Santa. Thats nice. What do you think hed like with that? Some milk? I think Santawould rather have a cold beer. DEAR! Psst! Wake up! Its Christmas! Are you sure? Its still dark out. Its four in the morning! Lets see if santa left our loot yet! Oh boy! Well let Mom and Dad sleep another hour but we can at least count all our packages. I get to plug in the tree lights! Ha ha! Look at all this booty! Lets see which ones are for me! Heres one for you. Strange that Santa would go to the trouble to wrap a box of coal. Har har. Heres one for Mom. Heres one for me...This one is for Dad... Hey were are YOUR presents? Santa goofed up! Good thing tigers are naturally gifted to begin with. MOMM! DAAD! SANTA DIDNT BRING HOBBES ANYTHING! Uh oh. think quick Dear. It had better be a lot later than it feels like. Well heres a present from ME anyway. Hope it fits. The best presents dont come in boxes. Ill treasure this one forever.
26/12/88
Theres nothing prettier than new fallen snow on a clear freezing moonlit night. ...through a window that is.
27/12/88
I cant take bath in this! The waters BOILING! Ill scald myself! What are you trying to do cook me alive?? Well forget it! Im not getting in! By the time you quit fussing complaining yelling and screaming and actually take off your clothes and get it the water will be perfect. Boy does she know me.
28/12/88
Every day I have to get up and go to school. Nothing ever changes. Its just school school school. But not today. Today I go for the gusto. I think you should ask your Mom if its OK.
29/12/88
Boy did I get into trouble at school today. Wow. What happened? I dont even want to talk about it. Did it have anything to do with all those sirens about noon? I SAID I didnt want to talk about it.
30/12/88
Did you bring something for show and tell? You bet! I brought these charred rocks and ashes from my backyard. See? Dramatic proof that UFOs landed not a hundred feet from my house. Their retro rockets burned solid rock into this fragile grey dust cube! This is an old charcoal briquette. Even as we speak aliens are undoubtedly infiltrating the highest levels of our government.
31/12/88
Disgusting denizen of the deep the giant octopus glides across the ocean floor. At the sigh of an enemy he releases a cloud of ink and makes his getaway! MISS WORMWOOD!
01/01/89
Well its a new year. And Id say the first 10 hours havent been up to snuff. Did you make any new year resolutions? You bet! I resolved to quit hiding my feelings so much! From now on the worlds gonna know exactly what I think of it! Yes youve certainly been a model of self-restraint and understatement up until now. Well no more. And Ive also resolved not to put up with sarcastic tigers. If I see any Ill tell them.
02/01/89
Shovel shovel shovel! Why cant we get a snow blower?? We must be the only family in the world that still shovels the driveway by hand! Im freezing! It builds character. Keep at it. Pretty convenient how every time I build character HE saves a couple of hundred dollars.
03/01/89
Next time we go down I get to steer the sled. You?! You steer like an old lady! Yeah well Im sick of going over and through every obstacle on the hill. Every obstacle?!? We missed the briar patch didnt we?! By going down the gully and into the stream yes. Oh you make everything sound so terrible. You should be glad were alive.
04/01/89
This is the finest snowball ever made! Painstakingly hand-crafted into a perfect sphere from a secret mixture of slush ice dirt debris and fine powder snow. This IS the ultimate winter weapon. Yes this marvel of crystalline engineering wi... WHAP!! Another casualty of the seduction of art.
05/01/89
What do you think is the best way to get what you want? Is it better to hold fast and never back down or to compromise? I suppose its best to hold fast when you can and compromise when you need to. Thats a lot more mature than I think I care to be.
06/01/89
I think the short attention span of television is great. As far as IM concerned if something is so complicated that you cant explain it in 10 seconds then its probably not worth knowing anyway. My time is valuable. I cant go thinking about one subject on end. Im a busy man. ...whos been sitting here for three hours. ... at six thoughts a minute.
07/01/89
Theres something magical about having a fire. The crackles and snaps the warm flickering light... everything always seems safe and cozy if youre sitting in front of a fire. And if youve got a hot tiger tummy to lie against ... WELL!
08/01/89
Cmon wed better go outside for a while. How come? Moms getting that look. This will be the best snow fort ever built! OK the main fortress will be a wall five feet high and go from here down over that hill with turrets every 50 feet. Over here well build an inner wall in case we have to retreat and a bin to hold our snow ball reserves. Got it. Hmm... the snow doesnt pack too well does it? Its not wet enough. Gosh itll take forever just to build the outer wall... even without the turrets. Im cold. Me too. Lets go in. Maybe we can have some hot chocolate by a fire! This is more fun than actually building the fort anyway. Now where should we put the icicle spikes? All along the outer wall after the moat. Say I think you got more marshmallows in your hot chocolate than I did.
09/01/89
The bay doors open and out falls Calvin the C-Bomb! Calvin is bound to unleash the pure destructive force of a million A-Bombs! The world gasps in horror as he streaks towards his target! OH NO YOU DONT!!
10/01/89
Will you read this tonight? An Ode To Tigers? Hobbes wrote it. The zebras stripes are lacking hues So they dont compare to you-know-whose.Orange black and white is what to wear! Its haute couture for those who dare! Its camouflage and stylish too! Yes tigers look the best its true! This goes on? For pages. Pretty tedious isnt it?
11/01/89
IM HO-OME! KAPOW WUMPH! Great. The snow cushioned the blow to my spine so I can now die of pneumonia. Aww has oo got de sniffoos?
12/01/89
I like these cold gray winter days. Days like these let you savor a bad mood.
13/01/89
You try it and Ill watch. Sissy.
14/01/89
Look I put a snowball on top of this snowmans head. Now Ill be the next William Tell and Ill hit the snowball clean off! Ouch. Ahhh! He flinched!
15/01/89
Put er down here. You know these things should really come with air bags. Ready? Ready. OFF WE GO-O! Ooh! Yikes! Wow! See? I TOLD you. Help me gather up the sled you sissy.
16/01/89
The fearless Spaceman Spiff finds himself on the planet closest to star X-351! An alien approaches... but in the blinding light our here can hardly make it out! Is it friendly or hostile? What are you still doing in bed still? Get ready for school! Definitely hostile.
17/01/89
The school bus will be here any minute! Go! Scoot! Spaceman Spiff captured by vicious zogwards is about to be transported to the labor camp! Our hero hatches a bold plan! At the last second Spiff makes his break! Taking advantage of the planets low gravity our hero is away like a shot. Theres the bus... but why dont I see Calvin?
18/01/89
Spiff escapes! Did Calvin get on the bus? I didnt see. ... why? Someone just darted behind that tree. See there he goes again. Isnt that Calvin? The zogwargs have spotted him! Our hero inflates the emergency jet pack he keeps in his pocket and prepares for takeoff!
19/01/89
Calvin what are you doing? Youre supposed to be on the school bus! Get over here! Our hero blasts off with his emergency jet pack! Another daring escape for the intrepid Spaceman Spiff! Zounds! The Zogwargs are on rocket scooters! Spiff fires his death ray blaster! Its your own grave youre digging buster!
20/01/89
Young man you are in VERY big trouble! Why didnt you get on the school bus?! Now IVE got to drive you and your Dad will be late for work. Youve inconvenienced everyone! What have you got to say for yourself?! Give me liberty or give me death Zogwarg queen! Dont tempt me! And listen you call me Mom ... got it?
21/01/89
Hey Calvin how come youre late today? Why didnt you ride the bus? I was going to skip school but I got caught. Really? How? Mom had the wind for that final sprint. Your Mom had to CHASE you? I couldnt believe it when she cleared the hedge.
22/01/89
OK lets see... if the wind is blowing north-northeast at 6mph and I throw the snowball due west at 90 mph with a slight top spin ... Ha! Susie didnt even hear me sneak up. Now Ill cream her cranium with a barrage of snowballs! WHZZZ PUFF These darn crozz breezes! She didnt even notice! Youre the worst shot in the world Calvin! If it wasnt for gravity you probably couldnt even hit the ground! SMACK! I did it! I did it! Just when it counted I did it! Ha ha ha! Right in the kisser! Ha ha! Bad news Mom. I promised my soul to the devil this afternoon. Oh? That recently?
23/01/89
Yes can I have the tool department please? Thank you. Hello? How much are your power circular saws? I see. And your electric drills? Uh-huh. How big of a bit will that hold? Really? Great. So the assigment is pages two through four? OK thanks Susie. ...Sorry about that. Do you carry acetylene torches? OK ring it all up. This will be on Mastercard.
24/01/89
Look at all this homework Im supposed to do! I dont want to do this garbage! I want to play outside! Childhood is short and maturity is forever.
25/01/89
People are rotten. When I grow up Im going to live a million miles away from everyone! How will you survive? What will you eat? ... Well Mom could come by twice a day to cook I suppose. That would be quite a commute.
26/01/89
Get a load of THIS dumb assignment. Im supposed to write about an adventure I had! I havent had any adventures! My life has been a big bore from the beginning! Have I ever been abducted by pirates? Have I ever faced down a charging rhino? Have I ever been in a shoot-out or on a bombing raid? No! I never get to have adventures! What about the time you backed the car through the garage door? You call that an adventure? I didnt even get on the the highway.
27/01/89
When do you think well get a thunder and lightning storm? I dont kow. Probably not until spring. I think hes going to melt before we can bring him to life.
28/01/89
Hey Susie stand on this X. Why? No reason. Just do it. I dare you. No. Please? Cmon! Get lost. This may not work out as well as I thought.
29/01/89
The valiant Spaceman Spiff is led by his captors to a secret dungeon to be debriefed! Little do they realize that our hero doesnt WEAR briefs! Eat your dinner Calvin. Ugh. Poised precariously over a percolating pit of putrid pasta Spaceman Spiff is held prisoner! Still wont talk eh Earthling? Our heros mind races furiously! Hes had his chance! Lets make him eat! LOOK BEHIND YOU!! Fool! The human scum escaped! Not for long Zokbar-2! And tomorrow morning hell have cold manicotti for breakfast!
30/01/89
Wow youve made a lot of snowmen today! Yep. Theyre efficies. Each one represents someone I hate. When the sun comes out Ill watch their features slowly melt down their dripping bodies until theyre nothing but noses and eyes floating in pools of water. I wasnt aware you even knew this many people. The ones I REALLY hate are small so theyll go faster.
31/01/89
Im writing a book about my life. Its called Calvin: The Shocking True Story of the Boy Whose Exploits Panicked a Nation. Interesting title. Thanks. Specifically what exploits are you referring to? Thats the problem. Can you help me think of some I could do?
01/02/89
Hi Susie. Go away Calvin! Sit somewhere else! I dont want to know what revolting thing you have for lunch today. Relax Susie. Im not going to tell you what I have. Youd better not. I mean it. All Ill say is that I sure feel sorry for my tapeworm. MISS WORMWOOD! Hey! Did I SAY what my lunch is?! Did I?!?
02/02/89
Whats this? A crash test dummy. Now I can see if the hill is safe to go down. Off you go! Ooh I think Im going to be sick. Well I wouldnt have steered like THAT! He deserved it!
03/02/89
Oh no! The air pressure in this room is too high! Calvins organs are in danger of collapsing! He... hes about to implode! Weve got to get out of here! Theres too much atmosphere! Sit still and behave. We cant eat at fast food places all the time.
04/02/89
These television programs sure are rotten. There isnt an ounce of imagination in the whole bunch. What bilge. Who do they think is stupid enough to sit and watch this trash? You. If there was anything BETTER on Id watch THAT.
05/02/89
No text.
06/02/89
Youre taking a shower NOW? That means were going out tonight right? And you havent told ME to get cleaned up so that means Im staying home right? And if Im staying home that means youve gotten me a babysitter right? And that means youve probably hired ROSALYN again right?!? Brilliant Holmes. AAAHHHHHH!
07/02/89
Quick Hobbes! Weve got to hide! Mom and Dad got ROSALYN for our baby sitter again! And you know what THAT means! It usually means were in bed by 6:30. Right! No TV no horsing around NOTHING! She just walks in and sends us straight to bed! And then she doesnt even kiss us good nigh. Eww gross. You WANT her to?!?
08/02/89
Where are you going tonight? Why cant Hobbes and I come? Why do we have to have a babysitter? Were going to dinner and a movie just to have some time to ourselves OK? But we could come! Hobbes promises not to kill anyone! Wed be good! Really! Why wont you let us come? Why dont you want us around? Is the movie dirty? Whats the problem?! Gosh a dinner with real pauses in the conversation! Can you imagine?
09/02/89
Hi Rosalyn come on in. Calvins hiding upstairs from you so you may have an easy evening. That would be great. Ive got to study tonight for a big test tomorrow. Did you hear THAT? Did you hear THAT? Hee hee! Tonight: the revenge of the baby sat!
10/02/89
Hi Rosalyn! How are you? What are you going? Homework? Right. Ive got to study for an exam tomorrow so I want it quiet tonight. Got it? Oh you bet Roz. Hobbes and I wont make a peep. Can I see what youre studying? Dont touch anyth... I GOT HER NOTES! I GOT HER NOTES! RUN HOBBES RUN!! CALVIN!
11/02/89
GIVE ME BACK MY NOTES YOU LITTLE CREEP! Run! Run! What are we going to do? Shell kill us! Into the bathroom! Lock the door! Quick! CALVIN! Open this door or your parents will never find your remains! Boy some baby sitter! Here go your notes!
12/02/89
Hold still. Now boost! Lift! Cmon! Mph! Get your hand out of my eye! OK forward! On the way back youre carrying ME. Hey I got some mail. Its a valentine card. From Susie Derkins! It says Please be my valentine. Youre Susies valentine! Im not her valentine just because I got this in the mail am I? Does the post-master general know about this? Calvin and Susie sitting in a tree-ee! Kay-Eye-Ess-Ess-Eye-En-Gee! I dont have to KISS her do I?! Is that what valentines do??! Oh gross! First comes Lo-ove Then comes marriage Then comes a baby in a baby carriage! This cant be happening! I need a lawyer! She cant make me be her valentine! Here she comes! Here comes Susie! Hi Calvin. Get away from me! Im not your valentine! Take your card back! Eww! Girls! Yecchh! That card wasnt for YOU you moron. Didnt you read the back of the envelope? The back? Calvin please give this to Hobbes. HOBBES?! Me? Really? Hot dog! Smooch city here I come!
13/02/89
Calvin youve got two seconds to unlock this door and give me back my science notes! You know Rosalyn Id suggest you adopt a more humble attitude. You wouldnt want anything to HAPPEN to these notes would you? YOU SCUMMY LITTLE TROLL! When your parents get home Ill... FLUSH AUGH! Theres ONE page!
14/02/89
Youd better not have really flushed any of my notes! Ive got a big test tomorrow! Well then with that at stake our demands should seem very reasonable! DEMANDS?! You dont get any demands! Unlock this door! Boy youd think a high school senior would catch on quicker. We should write the school board. Torpedo tube ready Capn!
15/02/89
I sure hope you memorized this page already because youre never going to see it again! NO! Dont flush it! Tell me what your stupid demands are. Thats more like it! OK first we want to stay up until my parents drive in. Second we want you to go pick up a pizza and rent us a video player... YOURE OUT OF YOUR MIND! Third... are you writing these down?
16/02/89
I dont hear her out there any more. Rosalyn?? Are you listening? We have more demands! Do you think she went away? Why would she? Weve still got her science notes. Doesnt she want them any more? Whats she doing? Maybe shes calling the fire department to ax open the door. Really? You think so? Gosh thatd be GREAT! Real firemen with real axes! I hope they drive their biggest fire truck! I hope your parents are having a restful evening.
17/02/89
Rosalyn? Are you out here? Are you calling the fire departme... GOTCHA! OH NO! I didnt really flush your notes! Theyre all there! Go look! Please dont kill me! Phooey. Well its 7:00. We got to stay up half-hour later than usual.
18/02/89
Rosalyn? Were home. Hi Rosalyn. Did you have a quiet evening? Did you get your studying done? ... no huh? Im sorry but tonight is really going to cost you. Youre SURE no one else in this town will agree to baby-sit Calvin? Maybe YOU would like to spend a week on the phone!
19/02/89
Whats this? A Calvin decoy. Pretty good huh? Now I can find out who my enemies are! Ill hide behind that tree over there and watch to see who throws snowballs at the decoy thinking its me! Your enemies must not be very bright. Thats why theyre out to get me. They cant stand my genius. Hey Calvin! I see a way your plan might fail. Pipe down will ya? How can I hide when youre yelling to me from across ... SMACK! See there? My plan to discover my enemies was a complete success. Too bad you took off your coat and hat. You must be soaked.
20/02/89
Here we are poised on the precipice of suicide slope. Below us lie the skeletal remains of hundreds of little sled riders. Searching for that ultimate adrenalin rush we prepare to hurl ourselves over the bring! What fate awaits us? Ready? No. Life and death hang in the balance! A fraction of a second and one wrong turn are all that separate them! This isnt helping.
21/02/89
Dad says the anitipationo of having something is often more fun than actually having it. I think hes crazy. I hate waiting for things. I like to have everything immediately. I cant think of ANYthing Id rather anticipate than have right away. Can you? Death comes to mind. I dont know why I bother trying to have a little discussion with you when youre always so morbid.
22/02/89
I wish snow was dry so that you didnt get all cold and wet when you played in it. ...then again if snow was dry you couldnt pack it into snowballs. That wouldnt be good. I wish it snowed in summer. Wouldnt that be fun? ... Well no actually that would make it hard to run when you play baseball. Heck its OK just the way it is. Were glad you approve.
23/02/89
You can always tell when you get to OUR house.
24/02/89
I think our snow forts are too far apart.
25/02/89
Now lets see if Mom jumps out of HER skin.
26/02/89
CLUMP The pteranodon spreads his giant wings and...
27/02/89
Look at this Hobbes! I could order an official Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs Beanie! See It has a battery powered propeller on top and a big star on the front! Isnt that neat? You have to send in four box Proof of Purchase Seals to get it it says. Well dont just stand there or this will take forever. Ugh. This stuff always makes my heart skip.
28/02/89
Blechh I feel sick. Oh cmon thats only your second bowl of cereal. This stuff is pure sugar. But its FORTIFIED with eight essential vitamins so its good for you. Give me a break. This is like eating a bowl of milk duds. Look it says right on the box part of a wholesome nutritious balanced breakfast. And they show a guy eating five grapefruits a dozen bran muffins... You know why you shake like that? Vitamin deficiency Ill bet.
01/03/89
Morning Dad! Hows your breakfast? Fine. Oatmeal huh? A bowl of pasty bland colorless sludge. Yes. Why dont you go describe your OWN food somewhere else? Ill bet youd rather have a bowl of tasty up-smacking crunchy-on-the-outside chewy-on-the-inside chocolate forsted sugar bobms! Can I pour you some? No thanks. Im trying to reach middle age. What are YOU having Mom? Boring old toast and tea? YOU want the beanie YOU eat the cereal Calvin.
02/03/89
1 1/2 boxes to go and Ill have enough Proof of purchases seals to order the propeller beanie they offer. 1 1/3 boxes to go. Man Im EARNING this.
03/03/89
Hobbes I did it! I ate enough boxes of cereal to get all the proof of purchases seals I need! Now I can order my beanie! Oh boy! I cant wait to get it! Ill be so cool! Not for over a month. It says to allow six weeks for delivery. SIX WEEKS?!? Ill be OLD then! And Im sure your beanie will be the talk of the rest home.
04/03/89
Mom! Mom! Did my beanie come in the mail? Are you kidding? I just mailed your order this morning. Im never going to make it six weeks
05/03/89
I can never enjoy sundays because in the back of my mind I always know Ive got to go to school the next day. Its like trying to enjoy your last meal before the execution. A penny for your thoughts. Sorry MY thoughts are a buck a piece. A DOLLAR?! Thats outrageous. Your thoughts arent worth that! This one is. At a dollar its the bargain of a lifetime. I wouldnt pay a nickle for any thought youve ever had in your whole flea-ridden existence! That little remary just made the price ten dollars! TEN?? You cant extort me! Keep your stupid though! If you knew what it was youd BEG to pay ten bucks for it. Cmon just tell me what it is will you? Nothing doing pal. OK OK. Ill give you 25 cents. Thats all I have. Lets see it. Here! 25 cent! Now whats this big expensive thought of yours?! A fool and his money are soon par...
06/03/89
Gosh I cant wait to get my beanie! I hop it comes soon. Do you think it will? Its probably been almost six weeks by NOW dont you think. I ordered the red beanie. But what if its not in stock? Should I take the blue one or wait for them to reorder? A blue one would be OK I guess but I sure hope they have a red one. Ive always wanted a beanie like this with a propeller. Boy itll be so cool when I have it. I cant wait. Wow! A red beanie! ... or a blue one. Do you think it will come tomorrow? Do you? It had sure better. Yeah thats how I feel too.
07/03/89
How was school today? Oh it was a blast! ... Did my beanie come today?
08/03/89
Please let my beanie come today! I promise I wont ever be bad again! Ill do whatever you want! Please please please! Ill never ask another favor if todays the day I get my beanie! Did I get my beanie? Nope. WHATS IT TAKE HUH?
09/03/89
I cant believe this. Every day I get all my hopes up thinking my beanie will come... and then it doesnt. And for each day that goes by I figure the odds are better that it will come the NEXT day so my hopes get higher and higher before they fall. Its awful. But Ive been disappointed so often now Im finally getting numb to it. Maybe the mailman made a second trip today and delivered it in the last five minutes. Wow! I never thought of that! Cmon! Hes not numb.
10/03/89
The longer you wait for the mail the less there is in it.
11/03/89
Im home. I didnt get my propeller beanie today did I? As a matter of fact you did! ITS HERE! Ha ha! It took weeks and weeks of waiting but at long last its finally here! Now I finally finally get to put it on. Some assembly required. Batteries not included.
12/03/89
Tigers dont worry about much do they? Nope. Thats one of the perks of being feral. Im not having enough fun right now. Youre not? Im just having a LITTLE bit of fun. I should be having LOTS of fun. Its Sunday. Ive just got a few precious hours of freedom left before I have to go to school tomorrow. Between now and bedtime I have to squeeze all the fun possible out of every minute! I dont want to waste a second of liberty! Each moment I should be able to say Im having the time of my life right now! But here I am and Im NOT having the time of my life! Valuable minutes are disappearing forever even as we speak! Weve got to have MORE fun! Cmon! I didnt realize fun was so much work. Sure! When youre SERIOUS about having fun its not much fun at all!
13/03/89
Can you believe this? Ive got to assemble the beanie propeller and motor myself! What do they think I am an engineer? Look Ive got to insert these wires and this plastic switch! I cant do this! Here let me try. No! Get away! ILL do it! Youd probably goof it all up or... #snap* OH NO! See? Insult a tiger and you get bad luck! Every time!
14/03/89
MY MOTOR BROKE! THE PIECE SNAPPED! NOW MY BEANIE PROPELLOR WONT WORK!! AAGHHGHHH! I waited WEEKS for this and now its BROKEN and I didnt even get to WEAT it! STUPID ROTTEN PIECES OF LOUSY JUNK!! Its all YOUR fault! RRGHHGHHGH! MY fault?! I was just sitting here. YOU broke it! You WILLED me to break it! You did some subliminal thing! Dont deny it! I know you did! You MUST have! OK NOW Im willing you to go jump in the septic tank.
15/03/89
What are you mad at ME for?! Get away from me! I dont even want to talk to you! YOU broke your beanie motor not ME! I didnt do anything! You distracted me! I did not! I was just SITTING here! You broke it all by yourself! *sniff* *sniffle* ... all right... I know... But considering that my lifes in shambles right now could you at least take the blame?
16/03/89
Dad can you fix my beanie? I broke the propellor motor trying to put the pieces together. Well lets see. This isnt too bad. You just snapped the battery case. Ill just glue it together and insert the switch for you OK? There! Good as new! Now just let this sit awhile so the glue can set. You did it! You fixed it! I cant believe it! HEY MOM! Dad fixed something! He DID?? Your DAD?? ALL RIGHT! THATS ENOUGH!
17/03/89
Look Hobbes! Dad fixed my beanie! Well? Hows it look? Adjectives fail me. Im turning it on. Ready? Here goes. I dont seem to be lifting off. This is very peculiar. THATs the word I was looking for.
18/03/89
Im not flying! This beanie doesnt make me fly! Whats the point of a propeller beanie if you cant even fly when you wear it? What a rip-off! I ate all that cereal waited weeks and weeks to get the beanie assembled it myself and the dumb thing doesnt even fly! At least its not a TOTAL loss. It came in this great cardboard box. Oh boy! NOW well have some fun!
19/03/89
Sighhhhh WHAP sighhhhhh....

Cmon Calvin! This is the third time Ive called you to get up. I dont want to get up. I dont want to go to school. Well you HAVE to whether you want to or not so lets move. For your information I dont HAVE to do anything I dont WANT to do. Is that so? She sure can make someone want to do something.
21/03/89
I dont want to catch the bus. I dont want to go to school. I dont want to be here at all. Im sick of everyone telling me what to do all the time! I hate my life! I hate everything! I wish I was DEAD! ... well no I dont. Not really. I wish everyone ELSE was dead.
22/03/89
Hi Calvin. HMPH. Oh YOURE real pleasant this morning. Whats the matter with you? Go step in front of a cement mixer OK? What a pill you are! What a jerk! Well who needs YOU?! You can stand there and be grumpy all by yourself! HMPH. Nothing helps a bad mood like spreading it around.
23/03/89
What are you so mad about anyway? Couldnt you find all the bugs you needed for your insect collection? Huh? Hey where IS your insect collection? Its due today. I FORGOT MY INSECT COLLECTION! OH NO!! Quick! Go home and get it! Maybe you can make it back before the school bus comes! Hurry! Run! No thats not what I meant. Help me find some ants. You forgot it ENTIRELY??
24/03/89
Dont just stand there Susie! Help me catch bugs! Are you crazy?! We were supposed to be working on our insect collections all this month! You cant do the whole thing on the last morning while you wait for the bus! How could you have possibly forgotten it anyway? Its all the class has been doing! Where have you been?? Dont you pay attention?! Dont you care about getting a good education?! If any bugs fly in your open mouth can I have them?
25/03/89
Here comes the bus Calvin. Its hopeless. Theres a bug! Youre wasting your time! The teacher is going to know you didnt spend any time on this insect collection. Stall the bus driver. Were supposed to have 50 insects. Youll be lucky to have ANY! GOT IT! Can you tell me what kind it is? Scrape it off. Get away from me!
26/03/89
Get up Calvin! Im not going to call you again! I bet. Youre going to miss the bus! Now get out of bed! You dont know the answer? Then sit down. Hey Twinky want to see if theres an afterlife? No you cant go play until you finish your homework. Just eat your food. You dont need to play with it. Stop stalling and get into the bathtub. No you cant stay up a little longer. Go to bed. Have a good nights sleep. Tomorrows another big! ... sighhhhhhh...
27/03/89
Phooey. No bugs in the bus window. I cant believe youre doing this. Hey ask that kid if hes got any bugs in HIS window. Calvin theres no way youre going to complete an insect collection on the way to school! Forget it! Sighhh... well maybe youre right. How much do you want for YOUR collection? Ill give you a quarter... or here 30 centrs. I SPENT A MONTH ON THIS!
28/03/89
Hey heres a worm! Worms are bugs arent they? Eww gross Calvin! Thats been floating in a puddle for days. Class doesnt start for 10 minutes. If I can catch 5 bugs a minute Ill get an Aon my collection. See Im off to a good start. Five bugs a minute?! Youre out of your mind. Heres another already. Thats a little ball of lint! Like Im sure the teachers going to look REAL CLOSE at every hairy bug in the 30 kids collections!
29/03/89
RINNGGGG Theres the bell. Weve got to go to class. Rats. I didnt get 50 bugs yet. What do you have? One drowned worm a piece of fuzzy lint that LOOKS like a bug a live ant and a smashed fly. Well if you label them scientifically in the next 30 seconds maybe youll get an F+. Weve got to LABEL these TOO?!? I was just going to put them all in an envelope. Actually I dont think theres any way youll get an F+. For all this work Id better at least get a D.
30/03/89
How did you mount your insects Susie? In this box with pins. Hmm... I dont have a box or pins. I guess Ill just stick my bugs on notebook paper. Oops. Tape doesnt work too well. Gross. I hope I can get him back together. Can I borrow your paste? The way youre going maybe youd prefer a stapler.
31/03/89
Psst... Susie! Help me think up scientific name of my bugs while the teachers not looking. Shhh! Were not supposed to talk in class. Do it yourself. Having a pleasant conversation Miss Derkins? Perhaps youd like to sit up front so you wont distract Calvin any more? Oh I TRIED to get her to be quiet but you know how girls are.
01/04/89
Ooooh that rotten Calvin! I hate him! I hate him! HES the one who didnt do his assignment! HES the one who was talking in class! HES the one who should be sitting here at the front of the room not ME! I wasnt doing anything wrong but IM the one who got in trouble! I sure hope Calvin feels terrible about this! Hey Susie Hows the view way up there? Ha! Ha! Calvin P.S. Try to steal a chalkboard eraser for me.
02/04/89
Three... two... one... LIGHT SPEED! Blasting across the galaxy in hyper light drive its Spaceman Spiff interplanetary explorer extraordin... Since Calvin seems to be enjoying the lesson lets have him demonstrate the next problem. ZOONDS! A Zok death sloop appears out of nowhere and fries Spiffs stabilizers! Our hero hurls out of control towar his imminent doom! The situation is desperate! This could be the end! What can our hero do?? His mind racing furiously Spiff springs into action! He downshifts his spacecraft and ... stalls. RINGG! Oh darn out of time. Once again Spaceman Spiff beats all odds to save the day!
03/04/89
Psst... here! Hey Susie Roses are red A deep crimson hue When you got in trouble You sure were too! Ha! Ha! Calvin. Calvin you dirty rotten lousy stinking nasty piece of moldy scum!!! Drop dead! I hope you... Writing notes in class now are we Susie? Hey look! Shes turning red again! EEP!
04/04/89
Oh no. How can this be happening? Ive been sent to see the PRINCIPAL! This is all CALVINS fault! Hes the one who got me in all this trouble! Im so scared! What am I going to do?? I think they make the hall to the Principals office this big on purpose.
05/04/89
Wow Susie got sent to the Principals office! Shes in trouble NOW all right! *wheww* I sure was lucky the teacher blamed Susie for everything. What a break! Oh no! What if Susie rats on me!? Suppose they make her sing! Suppose she squeals! Suppose she fingers me! Oh Im so relieved. I was afraid you wouldnt believe me. Oh yes weve got quite a file on our friend Calvin.
06/04/89
Here comes Susie back from the Principals office. Boy does she look plae. I wonder what happened. Shes talking to the teacher now. Psst! Susie what did they do to you? Did you get expelled? You didnt snitch on ME did you? You DID snitch! Youre a STOOLIE! A canary! Youre going up the river Calvin. Calvin will you come here please?
07/04/89
So FIRST I got in trouble for not paying attentioni n class and for turning in a last-minute insect collection which I got a D-minus on. THEN I got in trouble for getting SUSIE in trouble when I wanted her to help me fudge the project. THEN I got in trouble when I told Mom and THEN I got in trouble AGAIn when SHE told DAD! Ive been in hot water ever since I got up! Wow. Ill bet this makes you get your book report finished right on time. My what?
08/04/89
One of natures most peculiar-looking creatures the giraffe is uniquely suited to its environment. His tremendous height enables him to much on the most succulent morsels most difficult to reach.
09/04/89
Whenever I need to do some serious thinking I go for a walk in the woods. There are always a million distractions out here. I dont believe in ethics any more. As far as Im concerned the ends justify the means. Get what you can while the gettings good - thats what I say! Might makes right! The winners write the history books! Its a dog-eat-dog world so Ill do whatever I have to and let others argue about whether its rightor not. HEYY! WHYD YOU DO THAT?!? You were in my way. Now youre not. The ends justify the means. I didnt mean for EVERYONE you dolt! Just ME! Ahh...
10/04/89
GOTCHA!! HEY! Just what do you think youre doing back down HERE?! You didnt read me my rights.
11/04/89
Dad! Dad! Outer space aliens just landed in the back yard! Oh reall. What do they look like? Sort of like big baked potatoes with laser guns. I think we should do what they say. Did they say what they want? Yeah they want 10 dollars. Ill bet they do. Since youre so busy you can give the money to me and Ill take it over to them.
12/04/89
No text.
13/04/89
How come YOU always read me my bedtime stories and not Mom? Because reading the bedtime story is the Dads job. And it appears to be the ONLY Dads job around here! Left the dishes for Mom again huh? Tonights story is called Why Prince Charming Stayed Single. Prince WHAT?
14/04/89
Ive been thinking. Suppose I grow up to be one of the worlds greatest men of all time. Suppose my name will be an inspiration to humanity for eons to come! What will the history books say? Theyll say Much of his childhood was spent unwillingly in the bathtub.What an indignity this bath is! Is this situation worthy of one of the greatest men of all time?!? My likely historical significance is a terrible burden. Would you rather they said your childhood was dirty and smelly?
15/04/89
NNNGKGKK HOCCHHHH PTOOEY! Boy they sure go farther when you make em right! Lets make up a NEW contest OK?
16/04/89
IM HOME! YAHHHH SLAM! What a chump! KNOCK KNOCK Forget it you moron! Im not opening the door! You can just stay out there all night! Oh I cant WAIT to here THIS one explained.
17/04/89
HIC HIC HIC (hic) I have (hic) have (hic) I (hic) I have the (hic) the (hic) ... the hic (hic) the (hic) What is it? What do you have? A dollar?? A new comic book? What?? The (hic hic) I have (hic) the (hic) the hic (hic) the (hic) ... I love doing this.
18/04/89
Help me (hic) get (hic) rid of (hic) these darn (hic) hic (hic) hiccups! How? (hic) Scare me. OK... Our oceans are filled with garbage weve created a hole in the ozone thats frying the planet nuclear waste is piling up without any safe way to get rid of it... (hic) I mean SURPRISE me (hic). That doesnt?! Boy youre cynical.
19/04/89
Here. Drinking from the far side of the glass is supposed to cure hiccups. The (hic) far side of (hic) the glass? (hic) How do I (hic) do THAT? You have to bend your head way over. Oh (hic) I see. (hic) Thanks. Now Ive got the hiccups AND water up my nose. I think most hiccup cures were really invented for the amusement of the patients friends.
20/04/89
These (hic) hiccups are driving me (hic) crazy. Eat a spoonful of sugar. Thats supposed to help. Ill (hic) try anything. CRUNCH SMACK SMACK Well? Are you cured? (hic) Nope. Id better (hic) eat some more.
21/04/89
My hiccups are gone! They finally went away all by themselves! What a relief! AAUGHH! Did I scare you? Did I cure your hiccups? hic hic hic hic hic
22/04/89
Look Calvin I brought home some jelly doughnuts. Would you like one? No jelly doughnuts gross me out. Theyre like eating giant squishy bugs. You bit into them and all their purple guts spill out the other end. You can eat them. My friends ask me how I stay thin.
23/04/89
I cant sleep. I think nighttime is dark so you can imagine your fears with less distraction. At nighttime the world always seem so big and scary and I always seem so small. I wish I could fall asleep so it would be morning. Sighhhh... Look at Hobbes. HES asleep. Z. Heh heh... he sure looks funny when he sleeps. Tigers close their eyes so tight. I wonder what hes dreaming about. Good ol Hobbes. What a friend. Z. Things are never quite as scary when youve got a best friend. Z Z Z Z
24/04/89
Come ON. Calvin! We were supposed to have left a half-hour ago. WHERE are we going? For the hundredth time were going to a wedding. Now get in the car. Your Dads waiting. But what if I forgot something? Were only going overnight. Youll get by.
25/04/89
Turn around! We forgot Hobbes! Stop the car! We cant turn around Calvin. Were late already. But DA-AD!! You couldve been ready on time and had all your things together but you put up a fuss about going made us late and you forgot your tiger. Its your own fault. Youd turn around if wed forgotten MOM! Thats because shes the only one who knows where the place is. Har har.
26/04/89
When is this dumb wedding going to be over?! I dont even KNOW these people. This would be a lot more fun if Hobbes was here. I cant believe we left him at home. I hope hes OK. Whats he going to eat? We didnt leave any food out and well be gone almost two whole days! Hobbes will be starving! I think Ill let Dad go into the house first.
27/04/89
Hey Mom how do you make a long-distance call from our motel room? Dont play with the phone Calvin. Who on earth do you want to call? Hobbes. I want to make sure hes OK. Hobbes isnt going to answer the phone. Dont be silly. Youll see him tomorrow. But hes probably all lonely! Im sure hes having a good time. I hope he isnt renting some movie that I wanted to see.
28/04/89
Mom I cant sleep. Im sure you can if you just lie quietly. But Hobbes isnt here. Tigers are very comforting. I always fall right asleep when I listen to Hobbes breathing. Well you can listen to your Dad snoring. Thats Dad? I thought theose were trucks down-shifting on the highway.
29/04/89
Well were finally home! HOORAYY! Now I get to see Hobbes! Boy I didnt think wed EVER get home. The whole trip was one long complaint about leaving Hobbes behind. Next time we should take the tiger and forget the kid. Gosh its drafty in here... The windows smashed! Look at the glass! SOMEBODY BROKE IN!! HOBBES! FIND HOBBES!
30/04/89
True friends are hard to come by. I need more money. I wish people were more like animals. Animals dont try to change you or make you fit in. They just enjoy the pleasure of your company. Animals arent conditional about friendships. Animals like you just the way you are. They listen to your problems they comfort you when youre sad and all they ask in return is a little kindness. WHOOONK! *SOB* Its so... so TRUE! HOOOOT! THBPBTPTH! ... and speaking of a little kindness Id have a tuna fish sandwich any time soon that you happen to make one. Of course SOME animals get on your nerves once in a while.
01/05/89
Oh my gosh!! Somebody broke into our house!! Ill call the police! WHERES HOBBES? I cant believe this is happening! Look at this room! HOBBES! Oh I KNEW we shouldnt have left him here! Mom I cant find Hobbes! Help me find him! What if... what if they... Its OK Calvin. Calm down. Im sure Hobbes is here somewhere. I dont think anyone would steal a suffed tiger. Cmon lets go look. But Hobbes is so TRUSTING... sniff
02/05/89
The police say theyll send someone over. Have you figured out what all is missing? No were looking for Hobbes. Calvins almost hysterical. I feel a little hysterical myself. Ooh... I hope the police get here quick. Im scared. This is one of those things you always figure will happen to someone else. ... Unfortunately were ALL someone else to someone else.
03/05/89
Hobbes? Hobbes? Where are you?? I TOLD Mom and Dad we left Hobbes behind... I TRIED to get them to turn around and come back... and NOW look Hobbes was all alone when our house was broken into! Mom says Hobbes wouldnt have been stolen because hes not valuable. ...(sniff) Well I think hes valuable.
04/05/89
Hobbes? Are you down there? Youve got to be SOMEwhere! HERE HE IS CALVIN! I FOUND HOBBES! You FOUND him! Is he OK?? Hes not hurt is he? Hes fine. He was under the bed covers. Hobbes Im so glad to see you!! Youre safe and sound! (sniff) And now I am too! It looks like were a whole family again. Such as it is yes.
05/05/89
... and the televisions gone too. Do you happen to have the serial number? Ill bet the burglars got scared off when they saw there was a tiger in the house! Hobbes was here the whole time! Calvin not now OK? Im busy. Nobody sticks around long when he sees a tiger thats for sure! Mandibles of death thats what Hobbes has! Roght. Why dont you go tell your Mom? Maybe Hobbes should look at some mug shots. Can we go to the station and identify suspects? Huh can we? DEAR! I sure meet some weirdos in this job.
06/05/89
Ive swept up most of the glass from the window. OK Ill get something to cover up the hole. Do you think its safe to stay here tonight? Suppose the burglars come back! The police said theyd drive by and well leave lots of lights on. Ugh its so creepy knowing these goons have been in our house. I dont feel safe at all. I known. And this must REALLY be scary for a little kid like Calvin. Gosh I cant wait to tell everyone at school how our house got robbed. Be sure to say who scared the burglars away after they took the TV and jewelry.
07/05/89
Mild-mannered Calvin is stuck inside doing math problems on a beautiful Sunday. No one is watching! He dashes into his closet! THIS is a job for .... STUPENDOUS MAN! Defender of freedom! Advocate of liberty! A bright crimson streak blasts up through the atmosphere and then turns back toward Earth! Gaining stupendous momentum STUPENDOUS MAN strikes the ground at an acute angle with stupendous force! The Earth slowly stops rotating... and begins to turn in the opposite direction! Pushing with all his might STUPENDOUS MAN turns the planet all the way around backwards! The sun sets in the east and rises in the west! Soon its 10A.M. the previous day! What are you doing outside? Did you finish your homework already? Its Saturday! I dont need to do it until tomorrow... thanks to STUPENDOUS MAN!
08/05/89
Is Calvin asleep? Yes hes snuggled up with Hobbes. Boy I dont know how IM ever going to sleep. Me neither. I cant get over whats happened. The idea of some crazy stranger going through our house... BRRRR!! I wish I had a big stuffed animal to feel safe with. I guess youll have to do. So what do I get to snuggle? How come IM the grown-up??
09/05/89
This is going to be a long night. My heart jumps at the slightest sound. Its almost 2 and Im wide awake. When someone breaks into your home it shatters your last illusion of security. If youre not safe in your own home youre not safe anywhere. A mans home is his castle but it shouldnt have to be a fortress.
10/05/89
Are you still awake too? Mm-hmm. I was thinking. Its funny... when I was a kid I thought grown-ups never worried about anything. I trusted my parents to take care of everything and it never occurred to me that they might not know how. I figured that once you grew up you automatically knew what to do in any given scenario. I dont think Id have been in such a hurry to reach adulthood if Id known the whole thing was going to be ad-libbed.
11/05/89
Well at least we werent in our home when our house was broken into. No one was hurt. Were all together and OK. We lost a few of our nice things but things dont matter much really. Its hard to believe how often we forget that.
12/05/89
Can I be excused now? You didnt finish your dinner. Well I didnt like it very much and theres this TV show I want to watch so... Our TV was stolen remember? Gosh I guess Ill eat my asparagus do my homework and go straight to bed then. And were so proud of how you handle adversity.
13/05/89
This is where our television used to be. But we dont have a TV any more. Now we have a blank wall to watch. So here I am not being entertained. A pointless existence huh? I mean the wall is even plain old WHITE!
14/05/89
Dear Mom How do I love you? Let me count the ways. One... number one... hmm... nummmber one... mm... Hey Mom wake up! I made you a Mothers Day card! Why how sweet of you! I did it all by myself. Go ahead and read it! I was going to buy a card with hearts of pink and red But then I thought Id rather spend the money on me instead. Its awfully hard to buy things when ones allowance is so small... Ahem... ... so I guess youre pretty lucky I got you anything at all. Happy Mothers Day to you. There I said it. Now Im done. So how bout getting out of bed and cooking breakfast for your son? Im deeply moved. Did you notice the part about my allowance?
15/05/89
Good news Hobbes! Im starting a secret club and you can be in it! Oh boy! Itll be great! Well think of secret names for ourselves secret codes for our secret correspondence a secret handshake... Well have a secret club-house with a secret known to get in and well do big secretive things! Why all the secrecy? People pay more attention to you when they think youre up to something.
16/05/89
OK the first thing we need is a name for our secret club. Lets call it The Hobbes Fan Club! THE HOBBES FAN CLUB?! GIVE ME A BREAK! IM SURE! This is a top-secret society! The name should be something mysterious! Something vaguely ominous and chilling! Something like The Sinister Icy Black Hand of Death Club! I still like my idea better.
17/05/89
I got it! Well call our club G.R.O.S.S. - Get Rid Of Slimy girlS! That way Susie Derkins cant join! Is she slimy? ALL girls are slimy. Now the first order of business is to elect officers. I get to be president! I get to be president! Oh no you dont! This whole club was my idea so I get to be president. OK then I get to be king and tyrant. Hey no! THATS what I want to be! You can be President.
18/05/89
Hi Calvin! What are you doing making paper hats? Can I make one too? Dont be ridiculous. This is the official chapeau of our top-secret club G.R.O.S.S. - Get Rid Of Slimy girlS! Slimy girls?! I know thats redundant but otherwise it doesnt spell anything. Now go away. GIRLS ARENT SLIMY! Dont get gunk on me. I took bath last Saturday and Im all clean.
19/05/89
I cant believe you started a secret club just to exclude girls! Theres nothing wrong with girls! See Hobbes? Girls are so emotional. Youre the meanest most rotten little kid I know! Well fine! Play with your stuffed tiger! See what I care! I dont want to play with a stinker like you anyway!! Wow what a great club!
20/05/89
OK weve got a sign for our secret club so now we need to find a secret meeting place. I know! We can set up a card table in the garage! That would be perfect for drawing up maps and stuff! Hmm theres not much room with the car here. Lets push it into the drive. Shouldnt you ask your Mom to move it instead? Nahh. She wont care if we push it out. Cmon. In the past youve been a remarkably poor judge of what your Mom cares about.
21/05/89
BLIPP SPLOPP BLOOP BLIPP Lets face it were aesthetes. Here comes Susie. Just ignore her. Hi Calvin. Can I play with you and your tiger? Hobbes and I are NOT playing. Were doing big important things and we dont need to mess them up. It doesnt look to ME like youre doing anything important. Well we are so go away. Weve wasted too much time talking to you already. Youre just playing in the mud! Thats just what it LOOKS like to ignorant girls like you! Get lost! All right you little creep! I dont need you! Ive got better things to do than sit in the mud like a pig! A PIG?! By golly Ill show YOU! Dont bend over! Your curly pink tail shows! Oink! Oink! Oink! Oink! EAT SOME MUD SUSIE! Ha ha! You missed! Oink! Oink! Oink! Ahh spring! THat magical time of the year when a young mans fancy turns to love! Shut up.
22/05/89
Help me push the car out of the garage. I cant budge it myself. I still think you should ask your Mom to move it. Then shed probably say no and we wont have the garage for our clubhouse! But if you DONT ask her well get in trouble. We wont get in trouble! Every time you say that we go. Mom wouldnt care about these things if she wouldnt keep finding out about them.
23/05/89
Look stop being such a baby and help me push the car into the driveway. Well move it 10 feet. What could possibly go wrong?! Whenever you ask that my tail gets all bushy. Oh knock it off. Mom will be glad we did this ourselves and didnt bother her. Well she DOES hate to be bothered. Right. Now push! Push! Hey the cars not stopping! STOP! STOP! I think youre Moms going to be bothered.
24/05/89
STOP THE CAR! ITS STILL ROLLING! The driveway must be slanted downhill! Its going faster! WHOA! WHOA! Jump in and pull the emergency brake! I cant catch the door! Oh no! Oh no! Its going to go into the road! Dont follow it! LOOK OUT! WILD CAR!!
25/05/89
I havent seen Calvin for about 15 minutes now. That probably means hes getting in trouble.
26/05/89
The car is rolling into the road!! What if someone hits it?!? LOOK OUT! LOOK OUT! THERES NO ONE DRIVING!! THERE IT GOES!! I cant watch! GRUNTCH Nobody hit it! It just went into the ravine across the street! Hooray were dead.
27/05/89
Oh man oh man oh man. Oh man. What do you suppose a car like this costs? Ill bet at LEAST $75. Oh MAN.
28/05/89
Did you watch any television yesterday? No. Gosh what was yesterday like? I think life should be more like TV. I think all of lifes problems should be solved in 30 minutes with simple homilies dont you? I think weight and oral hygiene ought to be our biggest concerns. I think we should all have powerful high-paying jobs and everyone should drive fancy sports cars. All our desires should be instantly gratified. Women should always wear tight clothes and men should carry powerful handguns. Life overall should be more glamorous thrill-packed and filled with applause dont you think? I think MY life is too featherbrained already. Of course if life was really like that what would we watch on TV?
29/05/89
My life is flashing becore my eyes. Yeah I doubt your parents figured youd wreck their car before you were 16.
30/05/89
What are we going to do?? Well never get the car out of the raving. Should we act surprised like the car just rolled here by itself? Maybe Mom and Dad would fall for that. Or maybe they wont even notice if we just dont say anything. You think? I can be packed in five minutes. OK Ill try to get the maps out of the glove compartment.
31/05/89
Hi Mom! Hobbes and I are back! Do I have any clean clothes? I mean Im just wondering. Im going to make myself a few dozen sandwiches! Uh... Im REALLY hungry! No need to get up or look for example out of the window! Just stay where you are for another 10 minutes! Whats the matter with you? AAUGHH! Ha ha ha ha! Nothing! Uh why do you ask??
01/06/89
I got a couple of sandwiches made but I think Mom was getting suspicious. Are you packed? Wed better go! Should I take the yo-yo or the bubbles? ... or both? HOBBES COME ON! Well be lucky to get out of here with our LIVES! Moms bound to look outside any minute now and see the car in the ditch! If were not in the next county by then its curtains! Lets GO! Wheres a freight train when you really need one?
02/06/89
POOF POOF POOF POOF POOF OK (POOF)... I think weve got enough of a head start. We can rest a minute. Do you think your Mom has seen the car by now? Probably. Shes probably called Dad at work and hes probably on his way home now!
03/06/89
Well were surely in some other state by now. Lets stop here. Boy it never once occurred to me that Id be spending the rest of my life on the lam. Speaking of lamb what kind of sandwiches did you bring? How can you think of eating? Im so worried I feel sick. Really? Can I have your sandwich too? Six years old and a fugitive from justice. I cant believe it.
04/06/89
Ahhhh... Uh-oh. Something is seriously wrong here. The laws of perspective have been repealed! Objects no longer diminish in size with distance! Lines do not converge toward any point on the horizon. All spatial relationships are lost! Its impossible to judge where anything is! Oh no! CALVIN! Quite running around the house and crashing into things or Ill sell you to the monkey house! ... and now SHEs lost perspective.
05/06/89
Whats going on. I wonder. Why are all those cars slowing down as they go by? Gosh did someone have an accident? It looks like theres a car in the ditch! ... but I dont see anyone by it. And how on earth did they go in straight backward? To do that the car wouldve had to come... ...right...out...our...driveway!
06/06/89
Well Moms sure to have found the car by now and guessed what we did. Now I know what they mean when they say you cant go home again.
07/06/89
Whats that sound? I dont hear anything. There! Something is crashing through the brush! It It sounds big! Maybe its a bear! There are BEARS out here?? Climb the tree! Climb the tree! If you ask ME tigers are the only ferocious animals the world really needs. Boy 6 killed by bear! Parents saved the trouble.
08/06/89
Do you think were safe? Should we climb higher? Its hard to say with bears. There it is! The bears coming out of the brush! Oh no! It looks like its on its hind legs! Bears stand up only when theyre really mad!! Wait thats not a bear. Thats your Mom! AAUGHH! EVEN WORSE! CLIMB HIGHER! CLIMB HIGHER!
09/06/89
THERE you are. Come down so I can talk to you. No. Youll kill us. Were running away. Im not going to kill you. I just wanted to find out what happened. Are you OK? Was anyone hurt? No one was hurt. We were pushing the car into the drive and it kept rolling. The car didnt hit anything? It just went across the road and into the ditch. Thats when we took off. Well the tow truck pulled it out and theres no damage so you can come home now. First lets hear you say you love me.
10/06/89
Boy Hobbes isnt it funny how things sometimes work out? Mom and Dad saw right away that what happened to the car was an accident. They were so relieved no one got hurt that all we got was a lecture on safety and asking permission. They didnt even raise their voices. Parents are inscrutable huh? Send their car over a ditch and you dont even get yelled at. ...but try keeping live worms in your Dads... Lets not talk about that OK?!

AAUGH WHAM GRRRRRR You can take the tiger out of the jungle but you cant take the jungle out of the tigher! The question IS how can you get the tiger BACK in the jungle?

Heres the latest poll of household 6-year-olds Dad. An overwhelming majority expressed amazement at how little youve accomplished as Dad so far. The impression is that youre avoiding all the hard decisions that need to be made. In fact none of those polled could name a single instance of true paternal leadership. How about if I lead you upstairs to your bed? Ha ha. If we can be serious for a moment I have some innovative ideas about my allowance.
13/06/89
Look at all these ants. Theyre all running like mad working tirelessly all day never stopping never resting. And for what? To build a tiny little hill of sand that could be wiped out at any moment! All their work could be for nothing and yet they keep on building. They never give up! I sure suppose theres a lesson in that. Yeah... ants are morons. Lets see whats on TV.
14/06/89
Boy what a grouch.
15/06/89
Hi Hobbes! Watcha doin? Nothing. Nothing at all? Nope. Ill help. Please do.
16/06/89
ALIENS WELCOME COME AS YOU ARE! What will you do when your parents see this? By then I hope to be halfway to the next galaxy.
17/06/89
Oh no! Calvin has turned into one of his own childhood drawings! His anatomical references being obscure at best Calvin finds it difficult to move! Are these lower appendages feet or wheels? His own Mom thinks hes some kind of helicopter! If only Calvin had learned to draw better! No one understands my work. Thats what all artists say.
18/06/89
Do re mi fa so la ti do. A sparrow alights upon a tree branch. But this is no ORDINARY sparrow. This is a SONG sparrow. Swaying gently in the breeze he prepares to burst forth a rapturious melody! ON TOP OF SPAGHETTI ALL COVERED WITH CHEEEESE I LOST MY POOR MEEEATBALLL WHEN...
19/06/89
Where are YOU going? Out. Did you pick up your room like I asked you to? No. So when you say youre going out you really mean youre going back to clean your room right? English must not be her first language.
20/06/89
What are you doing down here again? Didnt I just send you to clean your room?! Twisted fiend! No four walls can hold STUPENDOUS MAN! Youve been foiled again evil Mom-lady! Ha ha ha! Oh yeah? ! Great Zok! Shes fixed her mind-scrambling eyeball ray on me! Im suddenly filled with the desire to go back upstairs and do her nefarious bidding! Glad to hear it.
21/06/89
Clean up your room! Clean up your room! Thats all I ever hear! Its MY room right?!? If I dont mind the mess what business is it of anyone else?! This is tyranny! I HATE cleaning my room! Its going to take me all DAY to do this! Ooh this makes me mad! A whole day shot! Wasted! Down the drain! Gone! AARGH! Are you kidding? How could this possibly take all day? Heck itll be another hour before Im even through griping.
22/06/89
Cleaning my room will go a lot faster if we BOTH work right? So Ill sit here and do all the tedious agonizing planning and organizing... ... you know making the tough calls and the hard decisious. You wont have to do any of that. All YOU do then is pick up what I tell you to OK? HEY! Did I SAY to pick up me?! No as a matter of fact I didnt! Get away from that trash can! IM the organizer! HEY!
23/06/89
I CLEANED UP MY STUPID ROOM! CAN I GO OUTSIDE NOW?! That didnt take very long. Lets se what kind of job you did. I did a GREAT job! See? Can I go now? Your room looks good. Now did you straighten up your closet like I asked you to? AAUGH! Dont open thaa... Back to work kiddo. YOU made THIS mess! YOU can clean it up!
24/06/89
WHACK Our favorite games are the ones we dont understand! You missed a wicket! No goal! No goal!
25/06/89
Youre out! I think the bases are too darn far apart. Ahh youre just a big sissy.
26/06/89
HELP! A BEE! A BEE! Run for your life! Hobbes! Did you see it?? It was the biggest bee in the whole world! It was the size of a Kaiser roll! It mustve weighed 70 pounds! It sounded like a helicopter and its stinger was like a harpoon! I mustve been a killer death bee! Man Im lucky it didnt get me! Life in the great suburban outback is certainly fraught with peril. If youd seen it youd have been scared too.
27/06/89
I cant imagine mastering the skills involved here without a clearer understanding of whos going to be impressed.
28/06/89
I saw the man oin the moon tonight. Mm. I didnt know the moon made faces. Thats phases.
29/06/89
The giant pteranodon hops to the edge of the cliff. There he spreads his bat-like wings and takes to the air! Soaring high over the prehistoric valley the pteranodon is truly a majestic sight! Thats it think majestic! Im thinking we shouldve picked a smaller cliff!
30/06/89
Its too darn hot out here. You could go wading in the creek. This water is too darn cold. You could go sit in the shade then. This shade is too darn dark. You could go sit in your room with the windows shut and the fan and lights on. Thats what I was doing when Mom threw me out here. I was kidding.
01/07/89
Give me some cookies or I soak you with this water balloon! Why you little thug! Dont you threaten your mother! And dont even THINK about throwing that in the house! Out! Out! Ill bet Id have gotten some cookies if I had filled this with PAINT.
02/07/89
CLICK Uh oh... The sky is a deep orange! Calvins skin is a pale green! Yellow flowers are now blue! Every color is the opposite of what it should be! Calvin has been transferred to a color film negative! His only hope is to be processed by a 1-hour photo finisher! Dveeloper! I need a developer! Doggone it Calvin! Thats ANOTHER picture ruined! Cant you look pleasant for 1/500th of a second?!
03/07/89
ITS JULY ALREADY! OH NO! OH NO! What happened to June?! Summer vacation is slipping through our fingers like grains of sand! Its going too fast! Weve got to hoard our freedom and have more fun! Time rushes on! Help! Help! I dont think I want to be here at the end of August. AAUGH! Its a half-hour later than it was half an hour ago! Run! Run!
04/07/89
Mom took me to the library today Dad. Thats nice. Did you get out a book? Yep. Its great! I had no idea books could be so much fun. And youll learn things too. Ill say! My book says that this one wasp lays its eggs on a spider so when the egg hatches the larva ieats the spider savings the vital organs for the last so the spider stays alive while its being devoured! Gross huh? Isnt there a street corner where he can hang out instead? And color pictures too! Want to see em?
05/07/89
Im destined for greatness. I just know it. Calvin the Great theyll call me. And think how lucky YOULL be! Youll get to tell everyone how you knew me as a kid! What a privilege! In fact all the papers and magazines will probably want to interview you to find out what Im really like. And boy will you have to cough up to keep me quiet. And whats THAT supposed to mean?!
06/07/89
Dad how does a light bulb work? Magic. Didnt you say thats how the vacuum cleaner works? Right. Theyre both magic. You just dont KNOW how they work. Ill bet. Fine. Dont believe your own father whos been around a lot longer than you. Look Mom magic! Thats not magic!
07/07/89
When you wish upon a star your dreams come true. I WISH I HAD A COOL MILLION DOLLARS RIGHT NOW! If Jiminy cricket was here Id skoosh him.
08/07/89
WHAP I DID IT! I CAUGHT IT! Im out.
09/07/89
Darlinggg Im home! And I brought a surprise! Lets hope its a divorce! Darling I stopped at the hospital on the way home from work. Dont call me DarlingOK? I brought home our new baby! A BABY?!

Well just PRETEND hes a baby! NO! This is idiotic! I refuse!! Playing housemakes me sick! Im leaving! I dont see why youll play pretend with your dumb oltiger but not with Mr Bun!
10/07/89
WUM WUM WUM Hows it going? Fine. Close the lid. Everything stops when you open it. I wish MY bathtub had an agitator.
11/07/89
Calvin will you gather the trash please? Gather the TRASH?!? What am I your personal SLAVE?! Why cant YOU do it? Fine I will. And YOU can start washing your OWN clothes and fixing your OWN meals and picking up your OWN toys and making your OWN bed and cleaning up your OWN messes day after day after DAY! Some women just werent meant to be mothers.
12/07/89
Whenever I cook an egg I like to see how high I can crack above the skillet. Then I aim with just one eye open so I dont have any depth perception. Its pretty hard that way. See the secret to having fun in life is to make little challenges for yourself. CRIKK Like the challenge of explaining the stove and the floor to your Mom? Rats. Lets see if theres another carton in the fridge will ya?
13/07/89
What are you writing? Im telling these companies I intend to boycott from all their products if they dont pull their ads from a TV show I find offensive. By golly if these companies are going to support objectionable TV programs Ill take my business elsewhere. Maybe I can scare away the advertising dollars and get the show cancelled. Why dont you just not watch the show? This clean wholesome television! Ughh it makes me sick.
14/07/89
I never liked ice cream cones too much until I discovered a new way to eat them. I bite off the bottom of the cone and suck out the ice cream as it gets soft. You wouldnt believe some of the awful noices you can make and it gets pretty sloppy when the cone gets soggy and both ends start dripping. In MY book food should be nutrition AND entertainment. Thats why we tigers like our food surprised and running.
15/07/89
Im so smart its almost scary. I guess Im a child progeny. Most children are. Huh? Nothing. People think it must be fun to be a super genius. But they dont realize how hard it is to put up with all the idiots in the world. Isnt your pants zipper supposed to be in the front?
16/07/89
FWOOSH Heh heh heh... Youre in trouble NOW Hobbes! Heh heh heh! While you have just ONE water balloon I have THREE! Im a walking arsenal of hydro-weaponry! Ha ha! I can see the fear in your eyes! You realize that I can get you three times wetter than you can get me! Throw your balloon and your utter sogginess is assured! I on the other hand can act with impunity! With three balloons I fear nothing! Catch! HEY! DONT! MY ARMS ARE FULL! OH NO! SPLOOSH GISSHH SPLASH FWOOSH We super powers have it tough. Maybe you should stock up on brains instead!
17/07/89
Well theres no delaying the inevitable. Lets get in the car. Where are we going? The same place we go EVERY summer: camping on some desolate rock at the end of the earth. AGAIN? Yep. This is how Dad likes to unwind. With everyone complaining? Right. He likes to watch us suffer.
18/07/89
Look Dad. Theres a town coming up. See the sign? Why dont we pull off find a nice motel and just stay THERE for our vacation? We could swim in the pool and have air conditioning and color cable TV and room service! No one would have to know we didnt camp! I wouldnt tell anyone! We could even go to the store buy a big fish take your picture with it and say you caught it! Cant we Dad? Cant we turn off here? Yes lets! Now dont YOU start!
19/07/89
Ta da! Were here! Good ol itchy island. Home of the nuclear mosquitoes. Bug bites build character. Yeah and last year you said diarrhea builds character. So think what a fine young man youre growing up to be. ... if all this character doesnt kill me first. That reminds me open the duffel bag and get out the spam. If the canoe isnt here in the morning it means Hobbes and I struck out for home.
20/07/89
Boy its great to be here! This is the life! I think Ill jump in for a swim. Want to join me? No thanks. Aw cmon. Itll feel great. Right. That lake couldnt have melted before yesterday. Hey lets go for a swim. Sure Dad. Id love to start the week with a little hypothermia. I think what I like best about vacations is the family togetherness.
21/07/89
Wake up Calvin. Its 5:30 and you can see the fish jumping. Mmf goway. Its a beautiful morning. The suns barely up and theres a mist over the water. Its perfectly still. Not a soul anywhere! Dont you want to see this? Leemeelone. I thought you said you wanted to go fishing. Youve got to get up early if you want to catch anything. Cmon the canoes all ready and Ive got your fishing rod. MOM make Dad go away! Another thing I like about vacations is the sharing of special moments.
22/07/89
Well I guess thats enough gishing for now. Mmm I cant wait to get back and have breakfast! I can almost smell the coffee from here! What a life! Hey where IS every... THERES GOING TO BE A SMALL MOUTH BASS FLOPPING IN SOME SLEEPING BAGS IN A MINUTE OR TWO! You know I really like it when you go off to work in the mornings. Its 6:30 already! Are you people going to waste the whole day?
23/07/89
Ahh... a day at the late! This will be great! I still dont see why we cant just sit in the car with the air conditioner on. IM GETTING SAND IN MY SUIT! I DONT WANT TO SIT ON THE BEACH! THIS WATERS TOO COLD! IM FREEZING TO DEATH! OUT HERE THERES TOO MUCH SUN! ILL GET SUNBURNED! THIS LOTION MAKES ME GREAY AND MY SHIRT MAKES ME TOO HOT! I DONT WANT TO SIT IN THE SHADE! THIS IS BORING! I HATE WALKING! MY LEGS ARE TIRED AND THE SAND IS TOO HOT AND THE WATER IS TOO COLD AND THERES NO SHADE HERE AND IVE STILL GOT SAND IN MY SUIT! What? Are we going already?
24/07/89
Ill bet Im missing some great TV shows.
25/07/89
Watcha doin Dad? Painting a picture? Yep. Youre giving your harmonica skills a real run for the money. Who asked you?
26/07/89
SNIFF SNIFF Z Hey what are you doing? Are you awake? Sniff sniff smack smack Youre dreaming stupid. Wake up. Mm! Why yes thank you some good fresh fish would hit the spot! Ooh theres a nice big one! AAUGH! I dont care WHAT all your clothes smell like! Im not washing anything now! Go to bed!
27/07/89
Ooh these bugs are awful! I itch all over! Dont scratch the bites or youll just make the itching worse. What am I supposed to do then? Its driving me crazy! Think about something else. Something else?! Like what?? Like maybe stepping out of all that poison ivy. I HATE THIS PLACE!
28/07/89
OK gang smile! Ack! Dont take a picture of ME! I havent washed my hair in three days and Im covered with bug bite! But dont you want something to remember our trip by? I dont want to remember this trip! Ive been trying to forget it ever since we got here! When are we leaving this dump? The next time I see one of those smarmy Kodak commercials Im going to put an ax through the TV.
29/07/89
This vacation sure went quickly. I cant believe its time to go home so soon. After being out here it will sure be a culture shock to go back to civilization wont it? Man I cant wait to get in the car and crack up the A/C and some tunes. Shake a leg huh? Someday Im going to get my DNA tested and see if hes really my kid. Take my word for it.
30/07/89
Why does the sky turn red as the sun sets? Thats all the oxygen in the atmosphere catching fire. Where does the sun go when it sets? The sun sets in the west. In Arizona actually near flagstaff. Oh. Thats why the rocks there are so red. Dont the people get burned up? No the sun goes out as it sets. Thats why its dark at night. Doesnt the sun crush the whole state when it lands? Ha ha of course not. Hold a quarter up. See the suns just about the same size. I thought I read that the sun was really big. You cant believe everything you read Im afraid. So how does the sun rise in the east if it lands in Arizona each night? Well time for bed. I hope someday Im as smart as Dad is. Why what did he tell you now?
31/07/89
Off to work eh Dad? Yep. It sure is a nice day. The kind of day just made for sitting under a tree and reading a good novel cover to cover dont you think? Too bad thats a luxury at your age. Well maybe you can do it when youre 65. Im sure youll be that old before you know it. Enjoy your day at work. Dad sure is surly in the mornings.
01/08/89
You know whats weird? I dont remember much of anything until I was three years old. Half of my life is a complete blank! I mustve been brainwashed! Good heavens what kind of sicko would brainwash an infant?! And what did I know that someone wanted me to forget?? Boy am I mysterious. I seem to recall you spent most of the time burping up.
02/08/89
MOM! Theres a big horsefly on the back of your head! Dont move! Ill get it! Ill get it! Is it still there? You didnt move did you? Get away from me!
03/08/89
Arr! Were bloodthirsty pirates! Avast ye scurvy dogs! Hoist the jolly roger and ready the plank! Here. Whats this? Our booty!
04/08/89
Hey Mom did you know that gravity in outer space works as if space was a soft flat surface? Its tru. Heavy matter like planets sinks into the surface and anything passing by like light will roll toward the dip in space made by the planet. Light is actually deflected by gravity! Amazing huh? And speaking of gravity I dropped a pitcher of lemonade on the kitchen floor when my roller skates slipped. How can kids know so much and still be so dumb?
05/08/89
You know. The world shouldve been designed so everyone didnt have to eat each other to survive. There should just be fewer people and animals to begin with. And the world certainly couldve used a more even distribution of its resources thats for sure. I wonder why nobody consulted you. Incredible isnt it?
06/08/89
No text
07/08/89
I performed a scientific experiment today. You know how maps always show north as up and south as down? I wanted to see if that was true or no. What did you find out? Not much. Your compass didnt survive the trip south from the top of the tree. MY compass?! Let me know when you get a new one. My junior scientist book says not to get discouraged by temporary setbacks.
08/08/89
Ive been thinking. You know how boring Dad is? Maybe its a big phony act! Maybe after he puts us to bed Dad dons some weird costume and goes out fighting crime! Maybe this whole Dad stuff is his secret identity! Maybe the Mayor calls Dad on a secret hot line whenever the ciys in trouble! Maybe Dads a masked superhero! If thats true he should drive a cooler car. I know. Ours doesnt even have a cassette deck.
09/08/89
Theres the stegosaurus out front! Theres the National History museum. Hooray! I cant wait to see all the dinosaurs! Cmon. Lets hurry! Its certainly been a while since weve been here hasnt it? At the museums request yes. Oh thats right. Calvin no biting people this time remember? RROWRR
10/08/89
What kind of dinosaur did you say this was? Its a stegosaurus! He looks pretty ferocious. No he was a plant eater. The tail spikes were for self-defense. Oh. Did tyrannosaurs fight these? Of course not Mom! Turannosaurs came millions of years later! Look try not to embarrass me when we go inside OK? Why are we going here if he already knows everything?
11/08/89
Look Hobbes heres an ancestor of YOURS! A saber-toothed tiger! Ha ha Ill bet HE was popular! If anyone needed to open a can of juice theyd just put him over it and hit him on the head! Ha ha! Hee hee Ill bet they died out because they couldnt understand each other! They pwobabbyy dokked wike diff! Ha ha ha! ... all in all though they were undoubtedly the pinnacle of prehistoric evolution.
12/08/89
Look Mom. The museum has a gift shop! Can I buy something? Theyve got dinosaur models dinosaur T-shirts dinosaur posters... I dont think you need any more dinosaur stuff Calvin. But Mom its all EDUCATIONAL! You want me to LEARN dont you?? Boy she fell for THAT one. Ill say! I wonder if we could get any Batman junk this way.
13/08/89
WUMP! WONNKK... I sh... shouldnt have wa... watched.
14/08/89
Oh no you dont! Theres only room for one in this pool and I was here first! If YOU want to cool off youll just have to jump in the sprinkler. Fine! Ill DO that. ! Doggone it I didnt mean for you to have FUN!
15/08/89
Z Z CRAACKK BOOM What do you think? A thunderstorm or a space alien ray gun invasion? Whichever tell me when its over.
16/08/89
Hows it coming? Slow. This dirt is real hard. Well thats a pretty good start. But Ive been digging all morning! This is going to take forever! Maybe youll have to settle for a smaller swimming pool. Yeah. This would kill you if you went off the high dive. Its too bad. Mom wouldve really been surprised to have an olympic pool where her garden used to be. Maybe shell be surprised anyway.
17/08/89
There! A gull pitcher of Calvins curative elixir! Well charge people a buck a glass and get rich! But thats just dirty water from the drainage ditch! There are leaves in it! Fortified with chlorophyll well say. Nobodys going to pay to drink that! Anyone can see its filthy! Its sludge! Hmm... maybe youre right. PiTCHER of PLaGUE. Calvins DeBiLitatiNG DiSEaSE DRiNK! $1.00 Not TO HaVE aNY
18/08/89
Ive decided not to go to school this fall. I dont need an education. I dont need to learn things. I dont need to develop skills. Its too much trouble. How are you going to make it in the world if you dont know anything and you dont have any skills?! Ill go on talk shows and hype myself.
19/08/89
Ughh there are times when I hate owning a house. All the maintenance! The walls need painting the roof needs to be fixed the tree out back needs to be sprayed... It seems like the whole place is falling apart. ... and what isnt falling apart is being actively destroyed!
20/08/89
A 30-ton brontosaurus ... is about to face a premature extinction! The allosaurus fearsome predator of the jurassic stalks his prey! The herd of brontosaurs is unaware of his presence! Spotting a straggler the allosaurus lunges! The brontosaurus rears to its full gigantic height! What induces an allosaurus to attack a monster more than twice his own size?! Im HUNGRY! The hamburgers are cooking Now get off me!
21/08/89
Calvin the hummingbird zips by with a loud whir! Although small he puts out tremendous energy. To hover his wings beat hundreds of times each second! What fuels this incredible metabolism? Concentrated sugar water! He drinks half his weight a day! ... preferably loaded with caffeine. Are you drinking more soda pop?!
22/08/89
Once upon a time there was... Hold it. Whats the matter? Has this book been a best seller? Has the author won a Pulitzer? Did the New York Times like it? I only want stories that come highly recommended. Are there any laudatory quotes on the dust jacked? Ahem... Once upon a time there was a noisy kid who started going to go to bed without a story. Has this book been made into a movie? Could we be watching this on video?
23/08/89
What are you doing? Im practicing my sneers. Theres nothing like a good sneer to dry up conversation. Hows mine look? Awful! Thanks. With this sneer I hope to be an unbearable burden at any social occasion. That will give you a real head start on beeing a teen-ager. I know! Its like getting seven extra years!
24/08/89
WHAP! Too late! I made another home run. (pant pant) Im quitting if we dont stop using this tennis ball.
25/08/89
AAAGH!! You should be more alert! You wouldnt last two seconds in the jungle. THATS WHY I LIVE HERE YOU DOLT!
26/08/89
What are you doing down there Calvin? Shh Mom! Go away! Susies coming down the walk and Im going to throw some crab apples at her. Oh no youre not! Put those down! AWWW MOM! Dont throw crab apples at ANYone. Theyre hard and you could really hurt someone. OK OK. What are you doing there Calvin? Shh Susie! Go away! Im going to throw this squishy old tomato at my Mom.

28/08/89
Mom wants me to make my bed. Come help me OK? OK. You get some pencils and Ill get some big paper! I thought we were making the bed. And do all that work?!? No were going to invent a robot to make the bed FOR us! Wont inventing a robot be more work than making the bed? Its only work if somebody makes you do it.
29/08/89
How are we going to invent a robot? We dont know anything about machines. Maybe YOU dont. Its easy. There are just four simple machines to alter force. The lever the pulley the inclined plane and um the internal combustion engine. Take my workd for it Im an expert at inventions. So where do we start? We ask Mom for a research grant.
30/08/89
Hi Mom. Can I look at your wallet for a few minutes? I uh want to see something. Hold on. Did you make your bed like I asked you? Im working on it. As I recall your bed is in your room. Im inventing a robot to make the bed but I need a grant. Can I have $50? Whatd she say? Did you get the money? Boy when were the cover story of popular mechanics Ill have some choice words to say about family encouragement.
31/08/89
OK the first thing our robot needs is a head. Should we use a coffee can? No thats too small. The head has to hold his tape recorder. See Ive made recordings for the robots voice! Really? Sure! This way our robot not only communicates but we can also program him to have the proper personality! Personality? Right. Robots should be RESPECTFUL. *click* How may I ease your life oh grand exalted master?
01/09/89
Hey Dad Im inventing a robot. Can you get me a patent? You invented a robot? Well here it is so far. Hobbes and I have been working on it all afternoon. Its not quite perfected yet but you get the idea. Hmm... what does it do? Thats the problem. We havent figured out how to make it do what we want. Dont get discouraged. Your Mom and I got the same results after working on YOU for six YEARS. Har har. My attorney is a comedian.
02/09/89
Well Hobbes we might as well give up. I cant figure out how to make a robot. This one doesnt do anything. Its past your bedtime Calvin. Youll have to leave your toys for tomorrow. OK Mom. Our robot wasnt working out anyway. Gosh and we spent all day on it too. I thought for sure our robot would save us from making the bed. And in a way he DID! Hey yeah! Were geniuses!

05/09/89
Hi Calvin! Arent you excited about going to school? Look at all these great school supplies I got! I love having new notebooks and stuff! All IVE got to say is theyre not making ME learn any foreign languages! If English is good enough for ME then by golly its good enough for the REST of the world! Everyone should speak English or just shut up thats what I say! You should maybe check the chemical content of your breakfast cereal. They can make me go until grade eight and then FFFT Im outta here!
07/09/89
The fearless Spaceman Spiff is being pursued across the galaxy by dreaded scum beings! Theyre gaining! Spiffs only chance to lose them is to release a giant smoke cloud behind his spacecraft!

Moe give me my truck back. Its not yours. It is NOW. You gave it to me. I didnt have much choice DID I?! It was either the truck or get punched. So? So I only gave it to you because youre bigger and meaner than me! Yeah? ... so? The forensic marvel has reduced my logic to shambles. Youre saying you changed your mind about getting punched?
13/09/89
That no-good rotten Moe! He wont give my truck back to me. The oaf will probably break it too. Should I steal it back? I know stealing is wrong but HE stole it from ME and if I DONT steal it back Moe will just keep it and thats not fair. They say two wrongs dont make a right but what are you supposed to DO then? Just let the biggest guy make up his own rules all the time? Let might make right? ... that sounds reasonable.
14/09/89
By golly I AM going to steal my truck back from Moe! Its mine and he has no right to have it! Ill just sneak up behind the swings here and when Moes not looking Ill run up grab the truck and take off. This playground should have one of those automatic insurance machines like they have in airports.
15/09/89
OK Moes got his back to me! Now Ill zip over steal my truck back and run like crazy! Hell never know what hit him! By the time he ses the truck is gone Ill be a mile away! Its a fail-proof plan! Nothing can go wrong! Its a snap! Theres no reason to hesitate. Itll be over in a split second and Ill sure be glad I have my truck back! Ill just do it and be done! Nothing to it! Its easy! Obviously my body doesnt believe a word my brain is saying.
16/09/89
Phooey who am I kidding? Id never get away with stealing my truck back from Moe. The ugly galoot is the size of a buick. Hmm... since I cant FIGHT him maybe I should try TALKING to him. Maybe if I reasoned with him hed see MY side. Maybe hed realize that stealing hurts people and maybe hed return my truck WILLINGLY. Maybe if Im really lucky I wont go through life with the nickname omelet face.
17/09/89
Eeesh. What goes down must come up. BLECHH! AGKH HEY! NO! DONT SPLOOSH HACK COUGH SPLUTTER MMF BLORP! UGH ICKK PTOOY YAA! ILL GET YOU!! Heh heh... Hello local navy recruitment office? Yes this is an emergency...
18/09/89
Listen Moe thats my truck and I want it back! Yeah? Yeah! Its my favorite truck. You had no right to take it! Yeah? Yeah! So give it back! NOW! Ill fight you for it. Ill bet my autopsy reveals my mouth is too big. Cmon wimp!
19/09/89
Im not going to fight you Moe! If you wont give me my truck back FINE! Go ahead and keep it! Youre the one who has to live with yourself! I cant make you do whats right! You can HAVE the stupid truck! OK thanks! Heh heh. Hey Kid if youre not gonna swing get off and let someone ELSE on huh?
20/09/89
... so Moe stole my truck and when I tried to get it back Moe wanted to fight me for it. I didnt want to fight so I walked away and Moe kept my truck. I dont understand it Hobbes. What makes some people so greedy and mean? Why is it that some people dont care whats wrong and right? Why dont people try to be nice to each other? The problem with people is that theyre only human. Well youre lucky you dont have to BE one.
21/09/89
You know sometimes the world seems like a pretty mean place. Thats why animals are so soft and huggy. ...yeah..
22/09/89
MOM! MOMM! What is it? Whats the matter? Hobbes had a bad dream. You woke me up at 2 A.M. because your suffed tiger had a bad dream?!? He dreamed he was so hungry he ate us allup. I must be having a bad dream. Dont you think you should make Hobbes a sandwich just in case?
23/09/89
Know what Dad? At the fresh fish counter in the supermarket you can buy real squid. They have them in a bucket. Theyre really gross. Mm Ill bet. CALVIN WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
24/09/89
Thats our son! *sighhhh* These pictures will remind us of more than we want to remember.
25/09/89
Have you seen my shoes? I thought I had them out right here. Your shoes? I dont know. They WERE right here. Where could they have gone? Were going to be late. Well I cant goe anywhere without my SHOES. Help me look. Theyre not leaving US behind with a baby sitter tonight!
26/09/89
DING DONG Its ROSALYN! Answer the door will you please Calvin? Hi Roz. My parents have changed their minds about going out so we wont be needing your services. Goodbye. Hi Rosalyn. What are you talking about Calvin? You cant go out if Mom cant find her shoes right? And what do YOU know about THAT? Uh nothing! Ha ha! Um why? Are her shoes missing? Id like to be paid in advance tonight.
27/09/89
Phooey. Mom and Dad left. Now were here alone with the baby sitter from the black lagoon. Hee hee! Do you think she remembers how last time we threatened to flush her science notes down the toilet? Ha ha ha! Our finest moment. OK you get in bed. WHAT?! Its not even 6:30! She remembers all right. She cant get away with this. Well call the rescue squad.
28/09/89
Rosalyn? What are you doing out of bed? I thought I heard something outside. I didnt hear anything. It was kind of a thump. Will you go look and make sure its not anything scary? Ill check but I didnt hear any thump. Yes... yes! Go out the door! Two more steps! Oh please oh please! Yes yes yes! See? Theres nothing out here.
29/09/89
See Calvin? Theres nothing out here. But I KNOW I heard something! Go look OK? Please? OK if it will make you feel... HEY! SLAM THIS WAS A TRICK?! WHY YOU SNEAKY LITTLE DROP ILL GET YOU!! Hobbes! I locked her out! Now we can watch TV and eat cookies till were SICK! Oh boy! This is the best weve EVER been baby sat!
30/09/89
CALVIN WILL YOU LET ME BACK IN THE HOUSE THIS INSTANT! Dont worry Rosalyn! Theres only a 50% chance of rain tonight! Ha ha! Shes trying to open the downstairs windows. Its OK. I already locked them up. YOU OPEN UP THAT DOOR! Hey Roz! Whats in your purse? Mind if we look??
01/10/89
Hmm... For THIS patient Im going to need more tongue depressors.All right whats wrong with you? ... like I care. My foot hurts Doctor. Your FOOT hurts? What kind of a stupid problem is THAT?! Youre the doctor! Youre supposed to find out whats wrong with it. Its psychosomatic. You need a lobotomy. Ill get a doctor. A LOBOTOMY?! Thats not what a REAL doctor would say! Yeah? Whos wearing the stethescope you or me? Heres a mallet. Do you want anesthesia? Wh... thats to test REFLEXES! Y-you dont know ANYTHING! How about a SHOT then? Like a shot in the mouth? That does it! I know more about medicine than you! Ill be the doctor now! Ow! Ow! Quit kicking! See thats why your dumb foot hurts! Stop it! Say it! Sai Im the doctor! OK youre the doctor! But Im not going to be any patient of YOURS! Im leaving! Fine! Good riddance! You ruin everything! The surgeon general should issue a warning about playing with girls. ID be Susies patient!
02/10/89
CALVIN IM TELLING YOUR PARENTS ABOUT THIS! NOW LET ME IN! Pipe down will ya Roz? Hobbes and I can hardly hear the TV! Youre not supposed to BE watching television! Hey if you go rent us a VCR and a mobie well put the TV near a window so you can watch too! LET ME IN! Are you 18? You could get us Venusian Vampire Vixens!
03/10/89
CALVIN! Hang on Roz. The phone is ringing! I hope its your parents! I hope they ask to talk to me! Boy youll be in trouble THEN! Its your boyfriend Charlie! Should I tell him that youre indisposed? Ha ha! No! LET ME TALK TO HIM! Say chas dont you think youre settling for too little in the girlfriend department?
04/10/89
Isnt it great to get out of the house alone together for a change? Its so nice and quiet. We should do this more often. CALVIN YOUVE GOT FIVE SECONDS TO OPEN THE DOOR BEFORE I BREAK A WINDOW! Im telling you Chuck your girlfriend is a psycho! I hope youre not makingany long-range plans around her.
05/10/89
Wow this is fun! All the TV shows were not allowed to watch and a bag of cookies each! SLAM! Hey what was that? AAUGH!! ROSALYN! H-how did YOU g-get in?? *gulp* whoops I think its past my bedtime.
06/10/89
It was all a misunderstanding! An innocent mistake! Let me explain! Calvin listen closely. Locking Rosalyn out of the house wasnt just MEAN it was DANGEROUS. If youd hurt yourself or if there was a fire she wouldnt have been able to help you. You go apologize to Rosalyn right now. I-Im sorry Rosalyn. And were sorry too. I PROMISE you Calvin will behave himself next time. An extra five would help there BE a next time.
07/10/89
Boy did I get in trouble. Stealing Moms shoes and making Mom and Dad late... then locking the baby sitter out of the house... whoof. Thats a lot to live down for just one evening. I feel pretty bad. And having eaten a whole package of Oreos doesnt help. You said it.
08/10/89
Why do animals always walk in circles before they lie down? Sorry. Privileged information. Z Psst! Hey kid! MONSTERS! What do you want? Theres a big shiny toy for you under the bed. Come get it! Oh sure! You just want me to come there so you can grab me with some oozing appendage slowly paralyze me with some vile secretion and devour me alive! Nice try! Forget it! Stupid monsters. All fangs and no brains. Psst! Tiger! Well give you some salmon if you push the kid over the bed! Is the salmon fresh? Hold on Ill check. Yeah its fresh. HOBBES DONT LISTEN TO THEM!!
09/10/89
Man this is boring! How am I ever going to read three whole pages of this by tomorrow? Its impossible! ... Impossible?? Why NOTHINGS impossible! Not for ... STUPENDOUS MAN! Bum ba ba daa dum bum ba ba daa dum
10/10/89
YES! Its ... STUPENDOUS MAN! Friend of freedom! Opponent of oppression! Lover of liberty! Great moons of Jupiter! Calvin (STUPENDOUS MANs 6-year-old alter ego) has three pages of boring homework to read! Its TYRANNY! Although STUPENDOUS MAN could easily read the assignment with stupendous high-speed vision the masked man of might has a bolder plan! With stupendous powers of reasoning the caped combatant conclused thateres no need for homework if theres no school tomorrow!
11/10/89
A blinding bolt of blazing crimson careens across the sky! Its STUPENDOUS MAN! Seconds later the amazing marvel alights upon an observatory telescope at Mount Palomar! With stupendous strength STUPENDOUS MAN carefully unscrews the giant lens... ... and blasts into space with it!
12/10/89
STUPENDOUS MAN circles the earth with a 200-inch telescope lens! Aligned perfectly with the sun the magnifying lens focuses the terrible solar energy... ... and fries a certain elementary school clean off the map! Now mild mannered Calvin has no need to do his homework ever again! Liberty prevails! Hows your homework coming along Calvin?
13/10/89
Uh oh its my arch-nemesis MOM-LADY! She cant discover my secret identity! Calvin? Are you doing your homework in there? Quickly STUPENDOUS MAN leaps into the closet to change back into his 6-year-old alter ego mild-mannered Calvin! Calvin? Are you in here? Unfortunately STUPENDOUS MANs cape is caught in mild-mannered Calvins zipper! Curses! This is going to be a good one I can tell. Geez Mom! Cant a guy have a little privacy?!
14/10/89
And why may I ask are you standing in your underwear in the closet? Oh no reason. Um.. I was hot. Youre SUPPOSED to be doing your homework! I dont need to do it now thanks to STUPENDOUS MAN! Oh yeah? It was great! He fried the school with a big magnifying lens in space! Im sure it will be in all the papers tomorrow. Boy shell be in trouble when she gives me my costume back. BIG trouble.
15/10/89
Thank you Claire. That was very good. ... all right whod like to go next? Anyone at all besides Calvin? HEY! For show-and-tell I brought these amazing fossilized bone fragments that I painstakingly unearthed from sedimentary deposits in my front yard! Though they look like ordinary driveway gravel to the untotured eyes of the ignorant layman I immediately recognized these as pieces of jawbone from a new species of carnosaur! In this dramatic illustration Ive re-created the complete Calvinosaurus as it would have appeared in the late Jurassic! Its coloration here is somewhat conjectural. Ill be publishing my full findings shortly! Undoubtedly Ill be the recipient of many lucrative paleontology prizes and in a matter of weeks prestige fame and fortune will be mine! When this happens you can be darn sure that those of you who were mean to me in school will suffer appropriately! Ill employ my resources to make your puny lives miserable! Ill crush your pitiful dreams and ambitions like bugs in the dust! ... but there IS an alternative! Im now accepting a limited number of applications to be my pal. The cost is just $20 per person and you can revel in the association for a lifetyme! Any takers? Oh yeah? Just you wait!
16/10/89
Uh oh Calvin the reptile is in trouble! As an ectotherm his body relies on the environment to warm or cool its temperature. Now that its colder outside Calvins body temperature falls and he becomes sluggish! Hell go into torpor if he cant find a warm place to lie! Leave the thermostat alone and put on a sweater if youre cold. I ... I dont have the en.. energy!
17/10/89
I heard that big cats dont purr. Thats true. Were too fierce and ferocious we dont ever purr. Well what do you call the noice you make when you get your tummy rubbed? Growling friendly-like.
18/10/89
Calvin your Mom and I looked over your report card and we think you could be doing better. But I dont like school. Why not? You like to read and you like to learn. I know you do. I mean youve read every dinosaur book ever written and youve learned a lot right? Reading and learning are fun. Yeah... So why dont you like school? We dont read about dinosaurs.
19/10/89
Ive got an idea Dad. Maybe Id get better grades if you offered me $1 for ever D $5 for every C $10 for every B and $50 for every A! Im not going to BRIBE you Calvin. You should apply yourself for your own good. Rats. I thought I could make an easy four bucks.
20/10/89
Hello? Valley hardware? Yes Im calling to see if you sell blasting caps detonators timers and wire. Just the wire? OK forget it. Do you rent bulldozers or backhoes? No no a rototiller wont do at all. I need something more like a wrecking ball. Do you know where I could get anything like that? No? OK goodbye. Looks like another boring day Hobbes.
21/10/89
I cant sleep Hobbes. Ive been thinking. What about? Well suppose theres no afterlife. That would mean THIS life is all you get. And THAT would mean Im sitting here in a bed as precious moments of my all-too-short life disappear forever. Honey wake up. Did you hear the television on?
22/10/89
Hey Hobbes! ... Hobbes! Its bedtime. Ooh I wouldnt have wanted to sleep through THAT. I wonder why we dream when we sleep. Do our brains get bored? I wonder why we dont just plain sleep. I think we dream so we dont have to be apart so long. If were in each others dreams we can plan together all night. Hey yeah! Well Ill see you in a few minutes ol buddy! Ill be there! Z Z
23/10/89
The strangest thing happened to me a few minutes ago. Oh? What? I was minding my own business when suddenly I was zapped into some sort of space void vortex! There I watched helplessly as an evil duplicate of myself from a parallel univere too my place on earth and... what have you done NOW? No no see it wasnt ME...
24/10/89
Heh heh heh! AHA! I see you! Sneaking up to pounce on me eh? Phooey. You see why MOST tigers dont chuckle to themselves.
25/10/89
Want to play a great game I invented? OK. Its called Gross Out. You say the grossest think you can imagine and then I try to think of something even grosser. Whoever comes up with the grossest thing gets a point and we play until someone gets 50 points OK? I think I already know whos going to win. Its weidt nobody ever played a whole game with me.
26/10/89
Pay attention to me.
27/10/89
Ive got to write a report for school. Whats your topic? Bats. Can you imagine anything more stupid? Heck I dont know anything about bats! How am I supposed to write a report on a subject I know nothing about?! Its impossible. I suppose research is out of the question. Oh like Im going to learn about bats and THEN write a report?! Give me a break!
28/10/89
Hell Susie? This is Calvin. You know this report were supposed to write for school? Yeah my topic is bats. Whats yours? Elephants? Hmm. Well are you going to the library to look up elephants? You are? Great! While youre there could you research bats too and make copies of all the information you find and maybe underline the important parts for me and sort of outline it so I wouldnt have to read it all? Howd it go? I really loathe girls.
29/10/89
His stabilizers useless his fuel about to explode our hero careens out of control over a strange unexplored planet! Yes its just another typical day for the incredible Spaceman Spiff! Zorched by Zarokes Spaceman Spiffs crippled craft crashes on Platet Plootarg! Dazed but undaunted our fearless hero sets off in search of a service station! Zounds! The zealous zarches have followed Spiff to the planets surface to finish him off! With a sudden chill our hero realizes the planets soft granular ground makes him easy to track! Thinking quickly Spiff runs backward so his tracks show him going the opposite direction! By continuing past a hiding place and doubling back our hero fools the hideous aliens! CALVIN! Its time to come in! We know he went this way. Well find him.
30/10/89
What am I going to do about this report on bats? Youve got to help me Hobbes! OK ... um first lets make a list of what we know. Yeah! Thats a good way to start! Great! Number one: what are bats? Theyre bugs arent they? Yeah put that down. #1 BATS = BUGS Are you sure? They fly right? Theyre ugly and hairy right? Cmon this is taking all day!
31/10/89
I think weve got enough information now dont you? All we have is one fact you made up. Thats plenty. By the time we add an introduction a few illustrations and a conclusion it will look like a graduate thesis. Besides Ive got a secret weapon that will GUARANTEE me a good grade! No teacher can resist THIS! What is it? A clear plastic binder! Pretty professional looking eh? I dont want co-author credit on this OK?
01/11/89
Hi Susie! Did you write your report? Yeah I spent all last evening on it. Did you? Well when you know as much as I do it doesnt take as long. Mine took about 15 minutes. 15 minutes? Lets see. I guess you wont be setting the grade curve THIS time Susie! Read it and weep. Bats: the big bug scourge of the skies. Note the professional clear plastic binder. Bats arent BUGS!
02/11/89
All right class who would like to give his report first? I WOULD! I WOULD! Why Calvin what a surprise to see YOU volunteer! You must have done a good job. Go to the front of the class. Oh boy! Now lets all pay attention. Go ahead Calvin. Thank you. Before I begin Id like everyone to notice that my report is in a professional clear plastic binder. Thats very nice. Go ahead. When a report looks this good you know itll get an A. Thats a tip kids. Write it down.
03/11/89
My report is on bats. ...ahem... Dusk! With a creepy tingling sensation you can hear the fluttering of leathery wings! BATS! With glowing red eyes and glistening fangs these unspeakable giant bugs drop onto... BATS ARENT BUGS!! Look whos giving the report? YOU chowderheads... or ME?! Calvin Id like to see you a moment.
04/11/89
Man alive! Can you believe what my teacher wrote on my report? She says I obviously did no research whatsoever on bats and that my scientific illustration looks like I traced the Batman logo and added fangs! Shes pretty perceptive. She didnt even give me credit for my professional clear plastic binder! What did your parents have to say? Nothing. And if youll give me a hand here it will stay that way.
05/11/89
Lets just sit here a moment... and savor the impending terror. Here we are perched at the peak of Mount Maim! Why? Because I like to experience life to the fullest! I say you dont fully APPRECIATE life until you risk losing it! I like to stare death straight in the eye and make him blink! If your adrenalin isnt pumping youre not really living! Right? Actually I think real living is sitting by a fire slurping marshmallows from the bottom of a mug of hot cocoa.
06/11/89
Hi Susie. What did you bring for lunch today? A swiss cheese and ketchup sandwich. Its my very favorite too. So I dont want to hear what gross thing YOU brought. Relax Susie. I bought cafeteria lunch today. Good. It appears to be cigar butts in a gallstone sauce. Thats beany-wienies! Really? Oh gross.
07/11/89
Hello? Hi Dad. Its me Calvin. Youre supposed to be at school! I AM at school. Are you all right? Whats the matter? Why are you calling? I told the teacher I had to go to the bathroom. Quick whats 11+7?
08/11/89
I was reading about how countless species are being pushed toward extinction by mans destruction of forests. Sometimes I think the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact us.
09/11/89
What are you DOING?! Youre going to be late for school! Hurry up and put your clothes on right. Its sad how some people cant handle a little variety.
10/11/89
I wonder why man was put on earth. Whats our purpose? Why are we here? Tiger food.
11/11/89
Z Z SNAP A little high-strung are we? We tigers all it lightning quick reflexes
12/11/89
Calvin suddenly realizes the world has no hue value or chroma! Have the photoreceptors in Calvins eyes stopped working properly or has the fundamental nature of light changed?? Perhaps some strange nuclear or chemical reaction on the sun has caused electromagnetic radiation to defy separation into a spectrum! Maybe objects no longer reflect certain wavelengths! Whatever the cause its clear to Clavin that theres no point in discussing things with his Dad! The problem is you see everything in terms of black and white. SOMETIMES THATS THE WAY THINGS ARE!!
13/11/89
Sighhhh... HEY! WHOA! WHOA! WAHHH BAM CALVIN QUIT BANGING AROUND!
14/11/89
Ow! What am I doing on the ceiling? Hmm... nothing else fell up. Just me. This is very strange. Even if I try to jump to the floor I land back on the ceiling! My personal gravity must have reversed polarity! Youd thing this is the type of thing wed learn about in science class but no we learn about cirrus clouds.
15/11/89
Having my personal gravity polarity reversed is a nuisance. How am I going to get up to the floor? Theres not anything on the ceiling that I could even climb up. How am I supposed to do my homework when Im trapped on the ceiling? Its impossible.
16/11/89
Mom and Dad wont be too happy about THIS. No sir. Dad will have to bolt my bed to the ceiling tonight and Mom will have to stand on a stepladder to hand me dinner. Then Ill have to hold my plate upside-down above my head and scrape the food off the underside! And if I spill anything it will fly 10 feet up to the floor and splot! This is going to be the most fun Ive ever had!
17/11/89
All this wide open ceiling space! I wish I could get my roller skates. Heyh maybe I can climb up this bookcase and when I get to the bottom shelf leap to a chair. Then I can pull myself across other pieces of furniture and work my way to the chest. I can hear Mom now: How on earth did you get sneaker prints on the underside of each shelf?!
18/11/89
There! I think I can jump to that chair and hang on to the back. GEERONIMOOO! WHOAAA! WHAM! Great. Just great. Calvin QUIT BANGING AROUND!
19/11/89
While lying on my back to make an angel in the snow I saw a greenish craft appear! A giant UFO! A strange unearthly hum it made! It hovered overhead! And aliens were moving round in view ports glowing red! I tried to run for cover but a hook that they had lowrd Snagged me by my overcoat and hoisted me aboard! Even then I tried to fight though they numbered many I poked them in their compound eyes and pulled on their antennae! It was no use! They dragged me to a platform tied me up and wired to my cranium a fiendish suction cup! They turned it on and current coursed across my cerebellum coaxing from my brain tissue the things I wouldnt tell em! All the math I ever learned the numbers and equations were mechanically removed in this brain-draining operation! My escape was an adventure. (I wont tell you what I did.) Suffice to say I cannot add so ask some other kid.
20/11/89
RRG! MMF! Getting any HOMEWORK done or are you just ruining furniture? Maybe Im hanging here for dear LIFE! Ever think of THAT?
21/11/89
Im TELLING you my personal gravity reversed its polarity! I fall UP now! Ive been trapped on the ceiling! I couldnt do my homework up THERE! My desk is on the FLOOR! You should be glad I wasnt OUTSIDE when it happened or Id be sailing through the ionosphere! Right. Now I dont want to hear any more nonsense until youre through with your homework understand? DONT LET GO! DONT LET GO!
22/11/89
Its... its a miracle! My personal gravity is back to normal! Glad to hear it. Now do your math. You bet Mom. Boy what a relief to be pulled down instead of up! Ill check your progress in a little bit. Uh oh.
23/11/89
This has been a most peculiar afternoon.
24/11/89
Ive got to get outside before I grow bigger! I suppose I should get my pituitary gland checked.
25/11/89
I know! Ill run downtown and find Dad at work! Maybe he can help! Hm... now which building does Dad work in? They all look the same. ... well maybe Dad can find ME.
26/11/89
Mom never lets me stay up to watch the TV shows I really want to see. Why not? She says theyre too educational. I watched a nature program on TV last night. Afterward I asked Dad if life was really nothing more than surviving long enough to reproduce before you became food for something else. Well he looked at me a minute and said he didnt know about the rest of it but he thought that the importance of reproducing was greatly overrated. Ive noticed in those programs how the young males often leave the herd at an early age. I think its GOOD that everyone becomes food.

Well? Hows youre math coming along? Ive almost started!
01/12/89
Oh brother! Another discussion about my study habits and the importance of homework. Ive tried explaining that its hard to study when ones size suddently starts increasing but does SHE care?! Hah! No its just blah blah blah like its all MY fault! Moms never been as big as a galaxy so she cant understand how anyone ELSE could be! Sheesh. Oops it looks like shes wrapping up. Better start nodding. Good. Im glad we had this little talk.
02/12/89
Doing homework? Yeahhhh.... Boy you missed the show. I just god a big lecture from Mom just because I got stuck on the ceiling and then grew so big I fell off the planet when I was supposed to be doing my math! Gee THATS not very fair. You said it. Here how about helping me hurry up with these problems? Sure! Tigers are great at math! Now what do these little horizontal lines mean? Thats a minus sign. Let me know when youre done OK? Ill be reading comic books.
03/12/89
YOU CALL THIS DECEMBER?! Pitiful. Just pitiful. Here comes Susie. Ooh if only I had a snowball Id smack it right across the back of her fat head! Ill bet Santa Claus heard that! Oh man I forgot! I hate this time of the year. Youd better say youre sorry. IM SORRY! IM SORRY! I DIDNT MEAN IT! Youd better say you LIKE Susie. WHAT?! Never! Thats going too darn far. Youd better say youd like to give her muchas smoochies! MUCHAS SMOOCHIES?! Hi Calvin what are you doing? Fighting. Go away. I dont know whats weirder that youre fighting a stuffed animal or that you seem to be losing. IM NOT LOSING! HOBBES CHEATS! Quit it you! Ow! Stop it! After today Ill bet Santa takes a shovel to the reindeer stalls to fill YOUR stocking. Youre no better off than I am buddy.
04/12/89
When are we going to get a Christmas tree? Oh I dunno. Probably a little after New Years. AFTER NEW YEAR?? Sure. We can just go up the street and pick the best tree from the neighbors driveways. WHAT?! Sometimes theres still tinsel on the tree too so you dont even have to decorate it! Well save time AND money! OK what did your Dad tell you THIS time?
05/12/89
Yes Calvin? You have a question? Yeah I was wondering if we could stop the lesson here and adjourn to the playground for the rest of the day. Of course not. Now then lets all turn to page 24 and... Miss Wormwood? YES? How about just ME then?
06/12/89
For Show and Tell today I have something that will astound and amaze you! This little guy can... Have you all had your shots?
07/12/89
Are there any monsters under my bed tonight? Of course not. Come under and see for yourself. Yeah come and see. Heh heh heh. Oh right! You think Im falling for THAT?! Who am I TALKING to if there arent monsters down there?! Umm.. Uh.. Theyre all teeth and digestive tract. No brains at all. Why were dust balls! Yeah LITTLE dust balls!
08/12/89
EWW! Whats THIS disgusting stuff?! Its spider pie. You can pick out the legs and give them to your Dad if theyre too hairy for you. S-s-spider p-pie? Why I believe were going to have a quiet dinner for once. I know I dont feel like opening my mouth. Hey I LIKE it!
09/12/89
Want to go play outside? No its too much trouble. FIRST Id have to get up. THEN Id have to put on a coat. THEN Id have to find my hat and put IT on. (sigh) Then wed run around and Id get tired and when we came in Id have to take all that stuff off. No way. So what are you going to do instead? Im just going to sit here and wait for a good TV show to come on. Ill tell your Mom to turn you toward the light and water you periodically. Instead of making smart remarks you could get me the remote control.
10/12/89
IM HO-OME! A tiny snowman! Why are you down there without a coat? Me? No reason.
11/12/89
What are you doing still in bed?! Ive called you three times! Youre going to miss the bus! Thats the idea. Im staying in bed until Christmas. I want tons of loot this year and I figure my chances of being good improve greatly if I dont get up. Disobeying your mother and missing the bus isnt good. Its bad. That darn Santa has got me every way I turn.
12/12/89
I hate this time of the year. Ive got to be good for two more weeks if I want any goodies this Christmas! Ill never make it.I TRY to be good! I DO! My heart is as pure as driven snow! Its just that well sometimes events beyond my control conspire against me! Im usually an innocent bystand... HEY I SAW you roll your eyes! So you dont believe me eh?! ME?? By golly each of your eyes will be rolling toward the other when IM through with you! Ha! I hope you asked Santa for some crutches!
13/12/89
Miserable miscreant! Question my integrity will you? I cant QUESTION it until Ive see some EVIDENCE of it! AUGHH! IVE BEEN FIGHTING! Only in the loosest sense of the word. SANTA HE MADE ME! I DIDNT MEAN TO FIGHT! YES HE DID! YES HE DID! HE STARTED IT! I DID NOT! DID TOO! DID NOT! DID TOO! LIAR! LIAR!
14/12/89
Look Hobbes no one SAW us fighting right? This can be OUR little SECRET OK? Santa doesnt have to know about this right? Maybe he does and maybe he doesnt. OK OK Ill even apologize! Im sorry. Hows that? See its OK to fight just a little bit if you say youre sorry afterward. You bit and kicked. I SAID I was sorry! What more do you want?! You could let me read all your comic books. OVER MY DEAD BODY! Dear Santa know what Calvin did today?
15/12/89
Boy if it wasnt so close to Chrismas Id pound you good! Yeah Id like to see you try! Oh no you dont! Youre not tempting ME! I want every item on my Christmas list so Im being GOOD. No matter what the provication! Here comes Susie Derkins. Really? Quick help me find a pine cone I can throw at... ...NO! Im being GOOD! Good! Good! Good! Youll never make it till Christmas. Give up now and enjoy yourself.
16/12/89
Hi Calvin. Are you bringing your stuffed tiger to school today? No hes just keeping me company while I wait for the bus. Oh. But actually hes been nothing but trouble today. Hes trying to sabotage my Christmas by making me bad instead of good. Fortunately I asked Santa for such great presents that I can withstand any temptation. Im being an absolute angel. What did you ask for? A heat seeking guided missile. I figured five minutes with one of THOSE babies will make up for this whole rotten month.
17/12/89
There. Now we need to get this on the roof. SANTA --- WEIGHTED DOWN WITH EXTRA TOYS? DROP EM OFF HERE! --- CALVIN. Ive been thinking. They say Santa knows if youve been bad or good right? Right. But think how many kids there are in the whole world! Nobody could be watching every kid every single minute! I mean Santas OLD! He probably takes naps! THe way I figure it Santa must just make a few random checks on us once or twice a week. Thats all? Sure. Hed catch enough bad kids that way to scare everyone else into being good most of the time. Hed create the impression hes watching more than he really is! Pretty shrewd. Yeah but now that Im on to him Im going to smack Susie with a snowball! If I do it quick the odds of Santa watching me at that exact moment are virtually nil! What if Susie tells on you? Ooh I didnt think of that! Shes a girl so she probably WOULD snitch! Phoeey. Well I sure hope Santas watching now seeing as Im being so good. Unwillingly good but good nonetheless.
18/12/89
Want to help me write a book? Sure. Whats it about? Well you know what historical fiction is? This is sort of like that. Im writing a fictional autobiography. Its the story of my life but with a lot of parts completely made up. Why would you make up your own life? Because in my book I have a flame thrower!
19/12/89
Still and quiet feline form in the sun asleep and warm. His tail is limp his whiskers drooped Man what could make this cat so pooped? Sheeshh...
20/12/89
Hi Mom! Im making my own newspaper to report the events of our household. Thats nice. Now Im looking for a page one lead story. Can I interview you? Sure. OK what are you cutting up there for dinner? Fish. Knife wielding mother hacks ichthyoid! Grim melee is evening ritual! Suburban family decours victim! Out of the kitchen! Out! Out!
21/12/89
Hi Dad. Im making my own newspaper to report the events of our household. Would you help me out? Sure what do you need? Well you can take your pick. Either you can give me 15 bucks to pay my labor and production costs... 15 bucks?! ... Or you can be the subjedt of a comic strip called Dopey Dad. So in the next panel Dopey Dad yells Its bed time for YOU young man! Hee Hee! Look how big I made his mouth!
22/12/89
Ooh hahh ooh hahh ooh hahh ooh hahh I wish wed ged ad aquariub!
23/12/89
What story would you like tonight Calvin? Hamster Huey and the gooey Kablooie! Oh no not again! Thats what you hear EVERY night! Lets read something different! I WANT HAMSTER HUEY! I WANT HAMSTER HUEY! Cmon well read a new story tonight. Youll like it I promise. No I wont! Ill stay awake until morning if you dont read Hamster Huey! I didnt remember Hamster Huey having quite that starcastic tone of voice. Or doing everthing so FAST.
24/12/89
and Santa if I get any lords a-leaping or geese a-laying youve HAD it. Hmm... That might not be politic. Im getting nervous about Christmas. Youre worried you havent been good? Thats just one question. Its all relative. Whats Santas definition? How good do you have to be to qualify as good? I havent KILLED anybody. See thats good right? I havent committed any felonies. I didnt start any wars. I dont practice cannibalism. Wouldnt you say thats pretty good? Wouldnt you say I should get lots of presents? But maybe good is more than the absence of bad. See THATs what worries me. ...OK assuming I can get an overnight letter to the north pole what would you charge to write me a glowing character reference? Oh no Im not going to perjure myself for you! MY records clean!
25/12/89
Ha ha! Its Christmas! Hurry up Mom and Dad! Its almost dawn! Here I got you a present. You got me a present? Gosh Hobbes how nice! I picked it out myself! Open it! Why its ... Its three cans of ... Uh... Salmon. Um thanks Hobbes. Gee I didnt get YOU a present. I feel terrible. I thought of that. See you could give me mine back! That would be a GOOD present! Well then here! Merry Christmas Hobbes! Why thank you! Its just what I wanted! Merry Christmas! Calvin did you know these cans over in the pantry?
26/12/89
Well here we are poised at the precipice of Pallbearer Peak on a flimsy sled! The mind recoils in horror to imagine the awful descent! Yes Its a thousand food vertical drop onto a boulder field lined with pricker bushes! Its a journey calculated to exceed the human capacity for blinding fear! Read to go? Ready!
27/12/89
New hat Dad? Yep. I like it. Thank you. So do I. AAUGH! Youre going to be late for work Dad!
28/12/89
You dont LIKE my Snowman House of Horror do you?!
29/12/89
I SEE YOU HOBBES! MAN WHAT A LOUSY SHOT! TIGERS CANT THROW WORTH A ... SMACK! I just threw the first one so youd turn around.
30/12/89
A new decade is coming up. Yeah big deal! Hmph. Where are the flying cars? Where are the moon colonies? Where are the personal robots and the zero gravity boots huh? You call this a new decade? You call this the future?? HA! Where are the rocket packs? Where are the disintegration rays? Where are the floating cities? Frankly Im not sure people have the brains to manage the technology theyve GOT. I mean look at this! We still have WEATHER?! Give me a break!
31/12/89
I asked Dad if he wanted to see some new years resolutions I wrote. He said hed be glad to and he was pleased to see I was taking an interest in self-improvement. I told him the resolutions werent for ME they were for HIM. Thats why were outside now. I WONDERED what the rush was. Im getting disillusioned with these new years. They dont seem very new at all! Each new year is just like the old year! Here another year has gone by and everythings still the same! Theres still pollution and war and stupidity and greed! Things havent changed! I say what kind of future IS this?! I thought things were supposed to improve! I thought the future was supposed to be better! The problem with the future is that it keeps turning into the present.

Before going down a steep hill like this one should always give his sled a safety check. Right. Seat belts? None. Signals? None. Brakes? None. Steering? None. Wheeeee

This is the part of winter I like best ... when you come inside freezing cold and soaked ... and you put on fresh dry clothes and run up to the warm kitchen where Moms got a steaming mug of hot chocolate waiting for you! Mom? Mom? HEY MOM! Calvin Im next door. Dont have anything to eat or youll spoil your appetite. Mom. Its going to be a long cold dark winter.
06/01/90
While IM doing this brain surgery YOU can make a donor and do a heart transplant! Forget it Calvin. Im not playing with you any more.
07/01/90
Ive decided to be more of a people person and make more friends. How come? I dont get enough presents. From now on Im devoting myself to the cultivation of interpersonal relationships. After all no man is an island. We all need love and the support of others. Were social beings with social needs. So as of today my goal is to be one with my fellow man to develop and foster those deep connections that ... just a minute ... Hey Susie! Heads up!! Ha ha!! Augh help help Ive changed my mind Hobbes. People are scum. I think TRUE happiness can only be found in the wanton indulgence of animals.
08/01/90
Look Hobbes my newest invention! Isnt that your transmogrifier? It WAS. But I made some modifications. See the box is on its side now. Its a duplicator! Ah. It combines the technologies of the transmogrifier and a photocopier so instead of merely making a reproduction on paper THIS machine actually creates a real duplicate! So our financial worries are over? And counterfeiting is just ONE of its many uses around the home!
09/01/90
Have you tested your duplicator machine yet? I was just about to. You can help. Oh boy! What will we duplicate first? Me. You?? Yeah! Mom wants me to clean my room so Ill duplicate myself and let the duplicate do the work! Smart huh? I can picture the look on your parents faces when they find out theyve suddenly had twins. Twins heck! This summer I can make a whole baseball team!
10/01/90
OK Hobbes press the button and duplicate me. Are you sure this is a good idea? Brother! You doubting Thomases get in the way of more scientific advances with your stupid ethical questions. This is a BRILLIANT idea. Will ya? Id hate to be accused of inhibiting scientific progress... here you go. Scientific progress goes boink? It worked! It worked! Im a genius! No youre not you liar! I invented this!
11/01/90
The duplicator worked! Hobbes meet my duplicate! Hey nice room. Oog Im not sure Im ready for this. OK Dupe! Hobbes and I are going out to play. You clean my room and when youre done Ive got some homework you can do too. WHAT?! Forget it bub! Find some OTHER sucker to do your dirty work! Last one outside is a rotten egg! HEY! COME BACK HERE! Hes a dupicate of you all right. What do you mean? THIS guy is a total jerk!
12/01/90
Where are YOU going? Did you clean your room like I asked you to? Im going outside. Calvin can clean his OWN room. I dont want any nonsense Calvin. Go upstairs. Calvin? Im not Calvin. Im his duplicate. Calvins in his room. What did I just say? No nonsense Calvin. Go clean your room. Boy you ARE a crabby lady! Who are you? Calvins cruel governess? That does it!
13/01/90
Cmon Hobbes. Wed better go find my duplicate before he gets me in trouble. Im telling you lady youve got the wrong guy! Im a duplicate of Calvin! Calvin is in his room! Well see abou tthat. Give me your coat. See Calvin? Theres no one here. Now thats enough games. Clean your room OK? Calvin? I dont see him Hobbes. Maye hes outside huh? Wed better hurry. I think I hear your Mom coming down the stairs.
14/01/90
The distant planet Z-12. Distant that is to everyone but Spaceman Spiff! The fearless explorer Spaceman Spiff cruises over the desolate dunes of an uncharted planet! No vegetation covers the rolling terrain. Millions of years of harsh exposure without an atmosphere has swept the surface clean. What strange chemicals must compose this alien soil! Crossing a rift the rocks abruptly change color! ZOUNDS! A huge mountain suddenly rises out of the plain! Our hero pulls up! Over the top Spiff discovers that it is not a mountain at all! The whole landscape is... is bedding for a horrendous monster! Zg! Mf! Huh? All right what time is it?! The creature appears hostile! With no time to lose our hero readies a hydro bomb!
15/01/90
Calvin! What are you doing outside? Didnt I just send you to clean your room two minutes ago?! No. I did too! Now get back upstairs. Im losing my patience for this game! She mustve found my duplicate! Cmon Hobbes wed better hurry before he gets us in more trouble! Number three hi! Im number two! Charmed.
16/01/90
Mom said she sent me upstairs a minute ago! That mustve been my duplicate! What a mess this is turning out to be! You said it! HE gets in trouble but IM the one who gets blamed! Wed better straighten him... AAUGH! Your duplicator is a big success. Oh no! Are you kidding? It burned out after the fifth one of us!
17/01/90
Oh no! My duplicates made duplicates! Hi were numbers two through six! Hobbes what am I going to do?! Better tell your Mom to put out the extra table settings. Look you guys have to stay in here and be real quiet! If my Mom finds out about this shell have a fit!
18/01/90
I dont know about the rest of you but Im going to get some cookies!
19/01/90
Calvin you know youre not allowed to eat cookies before dinner! Put those away! Did you clean your room yet? Im not Calvin. Im a duplicate. I dont want to hear about it. Now move! Ood some days that kid of mine ... WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?! Why? Are you taking a survey?
20/01/90
IM HOME! Hi. Hi Calvin. Hi. I SAID Hi. Hi. Knock it off Calvin. Dear have a talk with him. Hes been driving me crazy.

OK duplicates listen up. As long as youre all here and I dont know how to get rid of you we might as well cooperate. Specifically with five duplicates we can divide up the school week so theres one duplicate for each day. If the rest of us lay low we can take turns going to school and no one will be the wiser! Great! Now that still leaves us with the question of who gets the bed tonight. Well fight you for it.
23/01/90
Hi Calvin. Im not Calvin. Im duplicate number two. What are you talking about? We drew straws and todays my day to go to school. Were all taking turns so we each only go once a week. Calvin you are so weird Im not even going to talk to you. Im not Calvin. I wish I lived some-place where I went to a normal bus stop. Are you in Calvins class? Will you help me find his locker?
24/01/90
Calvin would you please demonstrate the hoemwork problem you were assigned yesterday? I wasnt here yesterday. Yes you were Calvin. Didnt you do your problem? Im not Calvin. Im duplicate number five. Duplicate number TWO was here yesterday not ME. Were all taking turns. Number two wil be back next week and you can ask him to do the problem THEN. Look I dont see whats so hard about this!
25/01/90
Guys? Its OK to come out! Its me number four. Im home. How was school today? Ahh I got sent to the Principals office just like numbers two and five did. Geez you guys! Even I dont get sent to the principal every DAY! Youre making me look bad! Look Calvin if you dont like our performance you can go to school YOURSELF! Whoa lets not jump to conclusions! Im just saying theres room for improvement. Hey four were you able to swipe any chalk? Yeah! The principal never frisked me!
26/01/90
Hobbes weve got to get rid of these duplicates! All they do is get me in trouble! Everyone thinks IM doing all these rotten things when really its a duplicate! Im being framed by my own doubles! RUN! HIDE! OUTTA MY WAY! It appears youve just perpetrated another crime. The worst part is that I dont even have the fun of doing the stuff Im getting blamed for.
27/01/90
All right what did you guys do NOW? Youd better hide Calvin! Your Moms on the warpath! CALVIN? Shes coming! Quick get under the duplicator box! There you are! What have you got to say for yourself? I want an explanation for this behavior! Tell her you need a bigger allowance! Yeah! Five TIMES bigger! Um can I get back to you on this Mom? NO.
28/01/90
Nyup nchyp. I think a burp died trying to get out of my mouth. Im thursty. THUMP. Monster eyes! HELP! HELP! ITS AFTER ME! ITS GOT ME! I CAN FEEL ITS TERRIBLE FANGS! CRASH BONK Sleepwalking again! Lets go back to bed honey. You had a nightmare. Oh it was YOU! It sure is creepy having a friend whose eyes glow in the dark. Its so we can see people who might be sneakin out of bed to fix a snack without making arrangements to share.
29/01/90
Boy Mom sure did read ME the riot act didnt she? I have an idea. Psst. Calvin! Is the cost clear? Did your Mom go away yet? Can we come out now? Oh no! Your Moms coming back! There she is! Stay in the box guys! Keep quiet! Yikes! Shh! Hobbes youre a genius! I dont hear her. Do you? Hey whats going on out there?
30/01/90
So long duplicates! What do you mean? Were not going anywh... ZAP! What did you transmogrify them into? Worms! Worms?! Well I didnt want them to be unhappy... Cool! Look at us! Ha ha! Lets go gross someone out!
31/01/90
Well Mom you dont need to worry about me getting into trouble any more. Oh really? Yup. See I made these duplicates of myself and THEY were the ones who were bad not me. Uh huh... But NOW look! I transmogrified them! OH CALVIN! DONT CARRY WORMS THROUGH THE HOUSE! OUT! OUT! Well there! You got me in trouble one last time. I hope youre happy! You sure you dont want to put us on your Dads dinner plate before we go?
01/02/90
Well Hobbes I guess we learned a valuable lesson from this duplicating mess. And what is? And that is um... Its that well... OK so we didnt learn any big lesson. Sue me. Live and dont learn thats us.
02/02/90
WHAP! DID YOU THROW THAT?!? Throw what? Let me see your mittens! There look! Flecks of bark pieces of gravel spots of mud and granules of ice! That was YOUR snowball all right! Thats the problem with having a signature style.
03/02/90
HA! YOU MISSED BY A MILE! NYA NYAHH! THBPTBH! Yes? Youre darn lucky I didnt get a snow blower for Christmas!

QUIZ: Jack and Joe leave their homes at the same time and drive towards each other. Jack drives at 60 mph while Joe drives at 30 mph. They pass each other in 10 minutes. How far apart were Jack and Joe when they started? It was another baffling case. But then you dont hire a private eye for the easy ones ...
06/02/90
Id planned to take the day off and spend time with a couple of buddies. My buddies travel light and theyre fun to have around. One travels in a holster and the other in a hip flask. My name is Bullet. Tracer Bullet. What people call me is something else again. Im a private eye. It says so on my door. The last thing I wanted this morning was a case to solve but the dame who brought it was persuasive. Most dames are somehow. Get to work Calvin. I told her it would cost fifty greenbacks a day plus expenses.
07/02/90
I stepped out into the rainy streets and reviewed the facts. There werent many. Two saps Jack and Joe drive towards each other at 60 and 30 mph. After 10 minutes they pass. Im supposed to find out how far apart they started. Questions pour down like the rain. Who ARE these mugs? What were they trying to accomplish? Why was Jack in such a hurry? And what difference does it make where they started from? I had a hunch that before this was over Id be sorry I asked.
08/02/90
First I figured Id try the Derkins dame. Susie and I never hit it off although occasionally we hit each other. Susie had a face that suggested somebody upstairs had a weird sense of humor but I wasnt going to her place for laughs. I needed information. The way I looked at it Derkins acted awfully smug for a dame who had a head for numbers and not much else. Maybe shes got something on Jack and Joe. The question is will she sing? No I wont tell you what the answer is. Do your OWN work!
09/02/90
The Derkins dame wasnt talking. Someone had gotten to her first and shut her up good. I knew Susie and closing her mouth wouldve taken some work. I needed a clue and a drink. One of them I knew where to find. Youve made enough trips to the water fountain. Finish your quiz. Suddenly a gorilla pulled me in an alley squeezed my spine into an accordion and played a polka on me with brass knuckles. Youse aint going nowhere flatfoot.
10/02/90
The inside of my head was exploding with fireworks. Fortunately my last thought turned out the lights when it left. When I came to the pieces all fit together. Jack and Joes lives were defined by integers. Obviously they were part of a numbers racket! Back in the office I pulled the files on all the numbers BIG enough to keep Susie quiet and want me out of the picture. The answer hit me like a .44 slug. It had to be the number they called Mr. Billion. Answer: 1000000000. Case closed! Times up. Bring your papers forward. What did you get Calvin? I think the answers 15.
11/02/90
Uh oh here comes Calvin... The incurable weirdness poster child. Hi Calvin. Whats with the mask and bucket? HMPH. This is a poem! Please do what youre told! And here is a bucket of water ice-cold! Please take this water and dump it on me! Dont hesitate! Do it A.S.A.P.! Just wait till YOU touch the pernicious poem place!! Oooh youll be sorry THEN! Whee! I love playing CalvinBall! This is a bag flag zone!
12/02/90
I missed the bus Mom. Oh no. Hurry! If we jump in the car you can zoom up pass the bus on a straghtaway drop me off at a later stop and I can ride the bus from there! Cmon! What are you waiting for? Rev up the car! Moms so lazy.
13/02/90
Readyyy.. Aimmm...
14/02/90
Bedtime kiddo. Aw Mom! Cant I watch the next program? No you need your sleep. Cmon. Can I watch another 15 minutes? Please?? OK just 10 minutes! Then Ill go straight to bed! Five minutes! Just five minutes OK? Turn off the TV. Look Ill just watch a few more commercials OK? See heres my favorite gum commercial! I guess that got pretty pathetic.
15/02/90
Oh NO! I just remembered that today is Show and Tell day! I need something to show and tell about! Why cant you think of these things more than two minutes before the bus comes? What can I take? Ive gotta take something! Ive ...ah... ACHOOO Never mind Mom! Do we have any plastic bags? I dont want to know. I dont want to know. I dont...
16/02/90
See? SEE? Starboard is RIGHT! PORT is left! OK so I was wrong for once in my life! Shut up.
17/02/90
AARGHH! I MISSED! Its these fuzzy mittens! The snow STICKS to em and you cant throw straight! Darn it! Darn it! Darn it! I HATE these fuzzy mittens! If only Mom had gotten me padded gloves instead of these no-good awful rotten fuzzy mittens! WHAP! Well Ill be! My fuzzy mittens HAVE pads!

ANY dumb kid can build a snowman but it takes a genius like me to create ART. This snow sculpture transcends corporeal likeness to epxress deeper truths about the human condition! This sculpture is about grief and suffering! One look at the tortured countenance of this figure confirms that the artist has drunk deeply from the cup of life! This work shall endure and inspire future generations!
21/02/90
Still making snow art? Yep! Yesterday your sculpture melted. This time Im taking advantage of my mediums impermanence... This sculpture is about transcience. As this figure melts it invites the viewer to contemplate the evanescence of life. This piece speaks to the horror of our own mortality! Hey stupid! Its too warm to build a snowman! What a dope! Ha ha ha ha! A philistine on the sidewalk. Genius is never understood in its own time.
22/02/90
Hows your snow art progressing? Ive moved into abstraction! Ah. This piece is about the inadequacy of traditional imagery and symbols to convey meaning in todays world. By abandoning representationalism Im free to express myself with pure form. Specific interpretation gives way to a more visceral response. I notice your oeuvre is monochromatic. Well cmon its just snow.
23/02/90
Dad if you threw a snowball at someone but deliberately missed would that be bad? Well I suppose that would be provoking so yes it would be a little bad. As bad as if youd hit the person? No not THAT bad but worse than if you hadnt thrown it at all. Suppose you just GRAZED the person. How bad would that be? Say maybe you knocked off his hat and his glasses or something. That would mean instant death.
24/02/90
Boys this pudding was great! Can I take a bowl upstairs to Hobbes? No I think youve had enough. I didnt say for ME. I said for HOBBES! Well I dont think Hobbes needs any either. WHY NOT?! Um... Because tigers need to stay lean and mean. Thats what she said. Im lean! Im mean! Tell her chocolate pudding makes my coat lustrous.
25/02/90
Theres Venus. Theres Mars. And theres Jupiter. And Im STUCK here. On a clear night like this you realize how incomprehensible the universe really is. I wonder what early man must have thought as he watched the skies. Hed see he was an infinitesimal part of creation but hed have no understanding of planets or stars or comets or anything. Imagine how big and mysterious the night wouldve seemed to him! Ill bet he felt very fragile and afraid dont you think? ... Hobbes? Hobbes?? ... h-hello? Anyb-body?? AUGH! WUMP! Ill bet THATs what he felt like! Saber-tooth tiger food! From now on Im going to stay inside all night and watch TV.
26/02/90
Why should I go to school?! Why cant I stay at home? Why do I have to learn? Why cant I stay the way I am? Whats the point of this? Why do things have to be this way? Why cant things be different? Life is full of mysteries isnt it? See you this afternoon. At 7:00am Moms not very philosophical.
27/02/90
All set? Yep! OK get read! NOW! SMASH Too bad the back of the camera opened when we landed. That wouldve been a great picture.
28/02/90
Ha! Ive got a great word and its on a double word score box! ZQFMGB isnt a word! It doesnt even have a vowel! It is SO a word! Its worm found in new guinea! Everyone knows that! Im looking it up. You do and Ill look up that 12-letter word YOU played with all the Xs and Js! Whats your score for ZQFMGB? 957.
01/03/90
Hey no TV until your homework is done. Its getting done. Not with you sitting HERE it isnt. Hobbes is reading my book for me. After Im done watching TV hell tell ME what the book was about and Ill tell HIM what the TV shows were about! See were doing twice as much in the same amount of time! Mom says YOU should watch TV and I should read the dumb book. Ugh I only like nature documentaries.
02/03/90
Hey Twinky gimme a quarter. WHAT?! Why should I give you my money?! Its for the Let Calvin Live Through The Recess Fund. Sounds like a worthy cause. His motto is Give before it hurts.
03/03/90
MOMMM! I NEED A DRINK OF WATER! Mphhh... Calvin its after midnight. Get a drink yourself. I cant. There are monsters under my bed! Im scared. OK... Ok... Ok... AAUGH
04/03/90
They mustve taken out an insurance policy on me... sighhh... ...sighhh...
05/03/90
OK Hobbes toss up this deck of cards and Ill plug the ace of spades! Oh boy a shooting trick! Go! BLAM bAM POW ZING BLOOIE BANG Here it is! Wow! Six clean holes through the ace! Pretty good huh? Want to know how I did it? I used a hole puncher ahead of time! Hmm on second thought Ill fold. Hey whats with this deck?!
06/03/90
This morning I had a wonderful dream. By holding my arms out stiff and pushing down hard I found I could suspend myself a few feet above the ground. I flapped harder and soon I was soaring effortlessly over the trees and telephone poles! I could FLY! I folded my arms back and zoomed lower over the neighborhood. Everyone was amazed and they ran along under me as I shot by. Then I rocketed up so fast that my eyes watered from the wind. I laughed and laughed making huge loops across the sky! ... Thats when Mom woke me up and said I was going to miss the bus if I didnt get my bottom out of the bot. 20 minutes later here I am standing in the cold rain waiting to go to school and I just remembered I forgot my lunch. Tuesdays dont start much worse than this.
07/03/90
I did it! I did it! Somehow I imagined the experience would be more rewarding.
08/03/90
Hewwo! Is Hobbesie-wobbsie sweepy? Ooh hes just a bog snoogie-woogie isnt he? Yes he IS! Hewwo snoogie woogie! GLOMP! HEY HEY! Ow! LEGGO YOU BLOODTHIRSTY CARNIVORE! OW! OW! OW! I can see why little tabby cats are so much more popular.

Once upon a time there was a ... Hold it. You know what ID like to see? Id like to see the three bears eat the three little pigs and then the bears join up with the big bad wolf and eat Goldilocks and Little Red Riding Hood. Tell me a story like THAT OK? And how should Hansel and Gretel meet THEIR untimely demise? The witch eats them and then the wolf eats the witch.
10/03/90
Hey Dad can I take the gas can for the lawn mower out in the back yard? Wah on earth for? Its 8;00 at night! I want to pour gasoline in big letters on the lawn... ...and set fire to it so airplanes can read it as they fly over! NO you cant do that! Dont be ridiculous! I dont even want to know what he intended to write.
11/03/90
Im hooOaaGHhH! AAAAAAAAA If you ache its because you dont properly stretch before exercising. I didnt know I was going to BE exercising!!
12/03/90
Do you... I mean does HOBBES want any tuna fish this week? No Hobbes stopped eating canned tuna. You know they kill dolphins to get it. OK Ill put it back. So what does Hobbes like now instead? Fresh swordfish steaks. He likes them grilled outside. Mm-hmm. How about peanut butter?
13/03/90
Heres some clean clothes. Will you put them away please? Hey my underwear isnt pressed! Neither are my socks! You didnt finish ironing. Buddy if you want your underwear ironed you can do it yourself! What kind of mother ARE you?! She should take more pride in her work.
14/03/90
I asked Mom if I was a gifted child... She said they certainly wouldnt have PAID for me. You can relate this little story when reporters ask how I went bad.
15/03/90
Mom! Hobbes is reading my comic books! Tell him to stop! I told him to go buy his own and he SNaRLED at me! Make him give em back! Maybe you should be glad hes more literate than most stuffed animals. But theyre MY comic books not HIS! Well you should learn to share. I dont think Hobbes will hurt them. Are you kidding?! He drew a mustache and glasses on every picture of nuke-man last issue! In PeN! Why dont you go play outside Calvin?
16/03/90
Hows your math coming? I dont DO math any more. I decided Im more of a visual person. Good. Visualize being the only 45-year-old in first grade. Visualizing a few sums now eh? Actually Im visualizing YOU in traction. Help me do these OK?
17/03/90
Hey Hobbes Ill give you 20 questions to guess what I have in my hands OK? OK. Is it loathsome? Yes! Is it some big centipede with poison pinchers? Centipedes have poison pinchers? I think so. Man its a good thing you guessed it so fast! With you its never too difficult.
18/03/90
It says here that Religion is the opiate of the masses. ... what do you suppose that means? ... it means Karl Marx hadnt seen anything yet. What are you watching? Garbage. This show would insult a 6-year-old! And I should know. So why watch it? All the other shows are even worse! Why watch TV at all then? Theres nothing to do. Nothing to do?! You could read a book! Or write a letter! Or take a walk! When youre old youll wish you had more than memories of this tripe to look back on. Undoubtedly.
19/03/90
Where do we keep the extension cords? In the pantry on the bottom shelf. Where do we keep the blades for Dads electric saw? In the... Why do you want to know? Huh? Oh Im just making an inventory list so well always know where to find things. I get the feeling there was no right answer to that question.
20/03/90
Calvin come out from wherever youre hiding and take your bath! Do you hear me Calvin?! I mean NOW! OH NO! LOOK AT YOU! AUGH! GET OFF THE RUG! Like its MY fault she hasnt gotten the chimney swept.
21/03/90
Mom! Mom! I just saw the first robin of spring! Call the newspaper quick! Ha ha! A front page write-up! A commemorative plaque! A civic ceremony! All for me! Hooray! Hooray! Oh boy! Should I put the prize money in a trust fund or blow it all at once? Ha ha! I cant believe I did it! Calvin... Its a hard bitter cruel world to have to grow up in Hobbes. Cheer up! Did I tell you I saw a robin yesterday?
22/03/90
I sure like chocolate frosted sugar bombs! Look how brown the milk gets! Ugh. Want to see something weird? Look at the nutritional information on the back panel. Wow. 100% of the daily recommended allowance of caffeine! Hey look! You can send away for a chocolate frosted sugar bombs Buzzy the Hummingbird doll!
23/03/90
Eenie meenie miney moe! Catch a tiger by the toe! If he hollers um... Uh... Heh heh... Who writes these dumb things anyway?
24/03/90
County library? Yes do you have any books on homemade bombs? Thats what I said. I need a book that lists supplies and gives step-by-step instructions for building rigging and detonating them. Well what about your other branches? Dont THEY have any books like that? Boy and people wonder why kids dont read.
25/03/90
What should we have Dad read us tonight? ... so in the next panel Supertoad goes Plooie and ... My what big teeth you have! Said little Red Riding Hood. The better to eat you with! Said the wolf ... tiger ... said the tiger and he pounced on Little Red Riding Hood. Just then a hunter came by and when he saw the wolf ... tiger ... when he saw the tiger he picked up his gun and ... and? ...and it was too late. The tiger ate them both and he lived happily ever after. The end. Good story Dad! Thanks! Sniff. I always cry at happy endings.
26/03/90
IM FREE! IM FREE! At last! Home sweet ho... Oh no. Hoo hoo! That was a GOOD one! Look how far we landed! A house with a tiger is never home.
27/03/90
Look at you! How could anyone get so dirty at school? I got this dirty just trying to walk in the front door! Ol catapult butt was lying in wait for me. Well it doesnt matter. Youd better get in the tub now anyway. A BATH?! But its the middle of the afternoon! Yes but I have to get in the shower before your Dad gets home so HE can take one. Why all the baths? Is there some epidemic going around? I told you this morning were going out tonight. Rosalyn will be here at 6:0
28/03/90
Look I know you dont like Rosalyn but shes the only babysitter I could get. And you remember our talk after what happened LAST time dont you? I want you on your best behavior tonight.You do exactly what she tells you. I dont want to come home and hear any horror stories OK? For goodness sake Calvin! Take a breath before you pass out on the floor!
29/03/90
What are we going to DO Hobbes? Rosalyn will be here in just a few hours! Do you think shell remember how you locked her outside last time? If she does were dead! Shell probably stick my head on a stake in the front yard as a warning to OTHER kids she baby-sits! Im almost sure that would violate some zoning ordinance. Well no matter what were in big trouble unless we think of something FAST! I suppose we could try being GOOD. I mustve gotten water in my ear. WHAT did you say? Nothing. Forget it.
30/03/90
Hi Rosalyn come on in. Thanks for coming again. No trouble. Hi Rosalyn! You dont need to worry THIS time. Calvin will be on his best behavior tonight. Even so Id like an advance. An advance? But... But... Dear may I speak with you for a moment? But we GAVE her an advance on tonight when she LEFT last time! I dont care. Just pay what it takes to get us out of here!
31/03/90
OK were going. ... and Calvin? Yes? GCKKHHK! I think Ill sit in the middle of the floor and look at the wall tonight. Good. Ill tell you when its bedtime.
01/04/90
Man the harpoons! Thar she blows!! Can Hobbes take a bath too? No Hobbes doesnt need one. Hold still. By golly what if I drown because nobody was here to rescue me?? Hobbes! Cmere! Mom cant know youre in here okay? Ill disguise myself with bubbles. Hmm ... you need a hat. Hang on and Ill get one of Dads. I like his gray one the best. Maybe you should wear a tie too. Ill be right back. Better hurry! I think I hear your mom coming! Dear! Why are you taking a bath?!? ... and wearing your best hat!!
02/04/90
This is awful! If we step out of line ONCE tonight Rosalyn will kill us and then Mom and Dad will kill us again when they get home. I guess thats that. What?! Admit defeat? NEVER! Things may look grim for us but NOTHING is grim for... ...STUPENDOUS MAN! Champion of Liberty! Foe of tyranny! Im going to get in bed now and avoid the rush.
03/04/90
A bolt of fiery crimson streaks across the sky! Its STUPENDOUS MAN! The fiendish baby sitter girl has a local household in her iron grip of terror! The man of mega-might zooms to the rescue! Im in luck! Baby sitter girl is momentarily distracted! Hi Charlie its Rosalyn. Yeah Im over at the little monsters house again. Hmm? No actually hes been pretty good tonight. Yeah I cant believe it.
04/04/90
Anyway Charlie Im sorry we couldnt go out tonight but this little creeps parents are so desperate to get away from him once in a while that they... YAHH! FREEDOM AND JUSTICE SHALL ALWAYS PREVAIL OVER TYRANNY BABY SITTER GIRL! Get off me Calvin you pest! Ow! Let go! Quit it! STUPENDOUS MAN has the strength of a million mortal men! Give up! Listen Charlie Im going to have to call you back. You wouldnt believe what this cretin is wearing. With muscles of magnitude STUPENDOUS MAN fights with heroic resolve!
05/04/90
OK Calvin you want to play rough huh? Great moons of Neptune! She must have super powers too! Youve got TWO seconds to get your caped butt in bed or Ill put it there for good! Oh no! The evil Amazon is using some psycho-beam to weaken my stupendous will! Im counting! ONNNNE... *Gasp* I... I... must resist! TWO! In a vermillion flash STUPENDOUS MAN is in the air!
06/04/90
With stupendous speed STUPENDOUS MAN is out the door! All right Calvin! Whered you go?! I know youre out here! Your parents told you to BEHAVE tonight remember?! Theyre not going to be happy when they hear about THIS! See if we had bought a dog instead like I wanted we could go out like this all the time. Honey we came here to relax. Lets talk about something else.
07/04/90
There is no way Im getting paid enough for this kind of aggravation. How could a kid with such little legs go so fast?! Secure in his secret fortress STUPENDOUS MAN plans his strategy! Baby sitter girl is no match for STUPENDOUS MANs stupendous intellect! Calvin youre in big trouble if you dont come out! You made it back alive! Of course! I made a stupendous dash as soon as Rosalyn went around the house! She STILL doesnt know where I am!
08/04/90
HEY CALVIN! Are we near a slaughterhouse or did you forget your deodorant?! DROP DEAD SUSIE! Youre so ugly I hear your Mom puts a bag over your head before she kisses you goodnight!! Its shameless the way we flirt. Whats it like to fall in love? Well... say the object of your affection walks by... Yeah? First your heart falls into your stomach and splashes your innards. All the moisture makes you sweat profusely. This condensation short circuits to your brain and you get all woozy. When your brain burns out altogether your mouth disengages and you babble like a cretin until she leaves. THATS love?!? Medically speaking. Heck that happened to ME once but I figured it was COOTIES!!
09/04/90
There goes Rosalyn around the house again. She still doesnt know you sneaked back inside. Now Ill change back into my secret identity alter ego! Uh oh. She saw the light on in this room. Shes coming in! Quick! Get in the covers! Pretend weve just been reading in bed! But she knows you attacked her and ran outside half an hour ago! That was STUPENDOUS MAN! Not mild-mannered Calvin! IVE been in bed with my PJs since 8:00. You think shes going to believe THAT? My covers are here. My pajamas are HERE. Its as plain as can be!
10/04/90
All right! I found you! Found?? Why what do you mean? Ive been in bed reading all evening with Hobbes. Dont give me that! You just now sneaked inside took off your silly costume and jumped in bed! I know what you did! Well youre gonna get it NOW bucko! Oh yea? What are you going to do to me huh? You cant send me to bed when Im already IN bed! Sorry to spoil your fun you eel! OK. Downstairs! MARCH! Hey you cant take me OUT of bed! I need my SLEEP! Hey! Hey!
11/04/90
While your Dad is taking Rosalyn home perhaps YOUD like to explain what happened tonight. Gosh Mom whats to tell? At 8:00 I put on my pajamas brushed my teeth and went straight to bed. Nothing happened. And this? Uh... LIES! All lies! Rosalyn made me do that just so Id get in trouble! She hates kids! None of that is true! I went straight to bed! Nice try Pinocchio. Well whod have thought Rosalyn would make me write a full confession?!
12/04/90
No TV for a week! What injustice! They think theyve won but they havent! ILL show em! I REFUSE to learn a lesson! Im indomitable! They cant change me! Ill sit in front of the TV all week even if I cant turn it on!
13/04/90
Dad will you explain the theory of relativity to me? I dont understand why time goes slower at great speed. Its because you keep changing time zones. See if you fly to California you gain three hours on a five-hour flight right? So if you go at the speed of light you gain MORE time because it doesnt take as long to get there. Of course the theory of relativity works only if youre going west. Gee thats not what Mom said at ALL! She must be totally off her rocker. Well we men are better at abstract reasoning. Go tell her that.
14/04/90
Mom can we go out to the highway? Do what? See Ill put on my roller skates and tie a rope from the car bumper to my waist. Then when I give you the high five you patch out while I ride behind at 55 mph! What do you say? Can we go? I sure wish YOU could drive.
15/04/90
Hey Mom can I drive now? No. How about NOW? KLUNK Oh no! Oh you stupid car! Whats wrong with you NOW?!? Thats it Mom! Go ahead and swear! We dont mid! CALVIN BE QUIET! Want Hobbes and me to go get help? You stay where you are Ill look under the hood. Kick the car Mom! It works on the TV! Look at all these cars going by. Nobodys stopping to help. Lets blow the horn! Maybe someone will come. BEEEEEP! Beep! Beep! AAUGH! HOORAYY!! Someone stopped! Were heroes!! Want me to call a tow truck lady? First call the police and report an infanticide.
16/04/90
Wow! Nobody is on the swings! I cant believe it! Ha ha! I almost NEVER get a swing at recess! This is great! No one is telling me to hurry up! Higher! Higher! Whee! ... either this is my lucky day or I missed the end-of-recess bell again.
17/04/90
Hey Calvin didnt you sign up to play baseball at recess? No why? You must be the only boy who didnt. All the others are playing in the back fields. You mean Im the only boy on a playground full of GIRLS?! It sure looks like it. Want to ride on the teeter-totter with me? Oh no! Im in COOTIE CENTRAL! I havent had my shots! Relax. Stupidity produces antibodies. Air filter! Air filter!
18/04/90
Why didnt you sign up to play baseball like the rest of the boys? Didnt you like sports? I dunno. Id just rather run around. I hate all the rules and organization and teams and ranks in sports. Somebodys always yelling at you telling you where to be what to do and when to do it. I figure when I want THAT Ill join the army and at least get paid.
19/04/90
Hey lookit the sissy who didnt sign up for recess baseball. Im not a sissy! Oh yeah? Youd rather play dolls on the playground with girls. I wasnt playing with dolls! Sure you werent! Let me see your Barbie doll you sissy wimp! Im not a wimp! In fact I was going to the office to sign up for baseball right now! Then again if Im not a wimp why am I taking the path of least resistance?
20/04/90
I signed up to play baseball every recess and I dont even like baseball that much. I mean its fun playing baseball with just YOU because we both get to pitch bat run and catch all at once. We get to DO everything. Mostly we just argue over the rules we make up! Thats the part I like! But this will be with TEAMS and assigned positions and an umpire! Its BORING playing it the REAL way! Do you have know HOW to play the real way? See thats another problem! Suppose they make me a halfback. Can I tackle the shortstop or not?
21/04/90
I hear you signed up to play softball at recess. Yeah but I didnt even want to. I just did it to stop getting teased. Well sports are good for you. They teach teamwork and cooperation. You learn how to win graciously and accept defeat. It builds character. Every time Ive built character Ive regretted it! I dont WANT to learn teamwork! I dont WANT to learn about winning and losing! Heck I dont even want to COMPETE! Whats wrong with just having fun by yourself huh?! When you grow up its not allowed. All the more reason I should do it NOW!
22/04/90
Aachoo! Gesundheit! Okay! How many monsters are under my bed tonight? Just one. Thats good Hobbes! We outnumber him! Hee hee! Wanna get him? Yeah! See if you can reach the baseball bat! Heh heh! Quit shoving you hogs! Mommmmm! Nice going Maurice.
23/04/90
Cmon lets go outside and try some catches before dinner OK? A little practice will make you more confident tomorrow at recess. I hate these father-son things. Go out a little bit and Ill hit you a grounder. Why did I sign up for this? I should just move. Ready? Now be sure to run up to the ball. Dont just let it roll to you. Are you OK? Sometimes the ball bounces up like that and youve got to be ready. Thags for the tib Dad. Fide my node and put id in ice so they can sew id bag od!
24/04/90
Goodness what happened?! You were only out there a minute! A grounder bounced up and hit Calvin on the nose. IB BLEEDIG! BY ODE DAD ID TRYIG TO GILL ME! Hold your head back honey. Heres some more tissues. Ib nod playig badeball eddy more! Nebber again! I hade it! Sit still so the bleeding can stop OK? I guess we can forget having a millionaire baseball player support us in our old age. Dear! All my charagder id drippig out my node!
25/04/90
Hows the nose? It finally stopped bleeding. I guess that means I have to go to school tomorrow. My whole life is a disaster. I get injured just trying to learn the skills it takes to play a game I dont even want to play! Your nose is probably all clogged up now huh? *snrkk* yeah why? If you snore Im tilting the bed so you role out of the window. Its always nice to have a sympathetic friend to talk to.
26/04/90
I see youre bringing a glove today. Did you sign up for recess baseball? Yeah dont remind me. Youre lucky that GIRLS dont have to put up with this nonsense. If a GIRL doesnt want to splay sports thats fine! But if a GUY doesnt spend his afternoons chasing some stuped ball hes called a wimp! You girls have it easy! On the other hand BOYS arent expected to spend their lives 20 pounds underweight. And if you dont play sports you dont get to make beer commercials!
27/04/90
Mr Lockjaw? Im Calvin. Im supposed to be on team five now. Oh yes youre the one who signed up late. Hmm... OK you go play left field. Left field. OK I know that. Lets see if Im HERE then left field would be... That way. Play DEEP left field. I guess this is pretty dep.
28/04/90
I think baseball is the most boring game in the world. Ive been standing out here in deep left field all this time and not a single ball has come out here! Actually I suppose thats just as well. I dont know what base to throw to anyway. In fact Im not even sure I can throw that far. Hey whats everyone doing? Are people switching teams or what? The guys at bat are now out HERE! Well Im sure someone would tell me if I was supposed to be doing anything different.
29/04/90
Ready? Let me check what the deductible is on my insurance policy... Munch munch. Would you care for a soft dring? OK. H-h-here y-you a-a-are! Any dessert? No thanks. Well be landing shortly. The captain has turned off the seat belt sign. Thank you for choosing Calvins flight Z40 non-stop to Stoney Gulch. Next time I wont take the dinner flight.
30/04/90
Our hero the fearless Spaceman Spiff is marooned on the most distant planet in the galaxy! Theres no hope of rescue from this bleak and isolated world! Oh what a desolate place to be trapped! Spiff tries desparately to repair his disabled spacecraft! CRACK High fly to left field! Whos out there?! Our hero pauses. Theres some commotion on the horizon. ALIENS! Spiff grabs his blaster!
01/05/90
Wheres the left fielder?! Somebody catch it! Left field?! Hey thats ME! Wow! A high fly right to me! I got it! I got it! I caught it!! HE CAUGHT IT! ITS AN OUT! WAP! Im just a natural athlete I guess. Hey whos HE? Isnt he on the other team?
02/05/90
Hey look who made the out! Its CALVIN! Heck it was nothing guys. When youre in top physical condition like me you can... You moron! What were you doing in the outflied?! Its a new inning! Were up to BAT! Huh? You caught the ball for the wrong team! You got our own guy out! What a dweeb! What a jerk! What an idiot! Oops I dropped the catch. It doesnt count now right? Get him off our team Mr Lockjaw! Can I hit him with the bat? Please? Please??
03/05/90
Hey stupid if youre going to get OUR guys out why dont you join the other team?! What were you doing in the outfield? Dont you even know how to play?! Cmon guys its just a GAME! This is supposed to be fun! Games are only fun when you WIN bonehead! Youre gonna make us LOSE! If you screw up again youre dead meat Calvin! Who taught you how to play anyway? Your grandmother? Wait till I tell the other teams about THIS! Mr Lockjaw I dont want to play any more. Theres too much team spirit. OK quitter! Goodbye.
04/05/90
I dont understand it Hobbes. The kids teased me when I DIDNT play baseball. Then they yelled at me when I DID play. Then the teacher called me a quitter when I STOPPED playing. Unless youre a star you cant please ANYone. In that case why not just please yourself? Because Mom wont let me move to Madagascar.
05/05/90
Its Saturday! What do you want to do? Anything but play an organized sport. Want to play Calvinball? YEAH! No sport is less organized than Calvinball! New rule! New rule! If you dont touch a 30-yard base wicket with the flag you have to hop on one foot!
06/05/90
How come we play war and not peace? Too few role models. Ill be the fearless American defender of liberty and democracy ... and you can be the loathsome godless communist oppressor. Were at war so if you get hit with a dart youre dead and the other
07/05/90
Today for Show and Tell I have a souvenir from the afterlife! Yes you heard right! Equally amazing is my own story of yesterday afternoon when I actually died of boredom! I was doing my homework when I suddenly collapsed! I felt myself rising and could see my crumpled body on the floor. I drifted up in a shaft of light and entered the next world! Eventually my heart started again and I came back to life... but not before bringing THIS back! A yo-yo? It was pretty boring THERE too. Lets have a look at that homework.
08/05/90
And so having eaten her fill the mother bird returns to her nest... ...where she regurgitates the worms to feed her hungry brood.
09/05/90
...sighhhhhh... CALVIN PAY ATTENTION! AUGH Theres no head rest on this chair! I should sue for whiplash!
10/05/90
Hey Mom did you feel anything funny when you got dressed today? Funny? What do you mean? Well tickly maybe... or scratchy? Anything like a bite or a sting? WHY? And what have you got behind your back?! Um... here you may want these. Well heh heh gotta run! Women! Always changing their clothes! After I get that kid youre next.
11/05/90
This time Im really going to learn how to ride that bicycle! Balancing on two wheels is just as easy as balancing on two fee... Id say that crossed the line from ironic coincidence to evil omen.
12/05/90
I dont want to do my homework. I want to have FUN. TOO MUCH STRESS IS UNHEALTHY YOU KNOW! I dont see why I had to come in.
13/05/90
Did you ask your Mom if you could jump off the roof? Questions I know the answers to I dont need to ask right? Is this blanket big enough? Perfect! See Ill just grab all the corners and make a parachute! You can watch as I float to the ground gently as a leaf. Geronimo!! Crunch! His Moms going to have a fit about those rose bushes.
14/05/90
Ive come up with a new system for doing homework. I call it effective time management or ETM for short. Ive drawn up a schedule for each school subject and I use this kitchen timer to monitor my pace. Thanks to ETM Im much more efficient and my work goes faster! RINGG There! My math minute is set up! Set the clock for my spelling assignment OK? Um your schedule calls for smaller time increments than this clock can measure.
15/05/90
No I wont take a picture of you.
16/05/90
KA ZAM! What?
17/05/90
EWW! What IS this?! It looks like COMPOST! Mom doesnt appreciate me.
18/05/90
Hey Hobbes whats a paper tiger? Its like a paper boy. You know a tiger with a newspaper route. Oh. This book makes no sense at all.
19/05/90
Hey Dad would you pay me a dollar to eat a bug. No youd have to eat a bucket of bugs before I pay you a dollar. A whole bucket? Or Id pay you a dollar to pick up sticks in the back yard. All my REAL skills are undervalued.
20/05/90
Hey Dad remember our car? Why sure. Wait a minute what do you mean remember? Hobbes I have a conjectural moral question. Maybe you can help. Sure. Suppose I did something bad should I tell Dad? How bad are we supposing? Well hypothetically lets say pretty bad like to his car hypothetically. How bad hypothetically to his car? Well lets pretend it was REAL bad. Should we pretend it could be fixed? If we imagined he could FIND the car we could pretend it might be fixed. I see. You can keep the book. Ill call the bus station. Que Pasa Senorita? I am el fugitivo!
21/05/90
On a distant planet Zark we find the empty red spacecraft of our hero the bod SPACEMAN SPIFF! Uh oh! Up ahead the rocks are charred with death ray blasts! A violent struggle took place here! And only the tracks of a large sinister alien leave the scene! What has happened to the earthling explorer? Calvin this is humiliating!! I dont want to go! Put me down!
22/05/90
Spaceman Spiff is being held prisoner by hideous aliens! What do they want with him? Spiff is soon to find out! Our hero is called before the alien potentate! ... where it becomes clear that Spiff is about to be sacrificed... ... to appease the evil god they call nollij! Up to the blackboard. Hurry up.
23/05/90
Staring death in the face our hero thinks fast. Inching closer to the sacrificial pit Spiff slowly and smoothly reaches for the tiny atom blaster concealed in his belt! YAA! All right you bloodsucking mutant chromosomal disasters! Nobody move! Im outta here! Calvin give me that rubber band right this minute! I SAID NOBODY MOVE!
24/05/90
Spiff escapes! The dank and smelly corridors of the alien fortress are deserted! All the aliens had gathered for the spectacle of our heros demise! The fearless space explorer makes it to the planet surface but the alien queen is in pursuit! Calvin get back here! Spiff jumps into the cockpit pressurises the launch thrusters and... blasts off! Our hero is safe! Tomorrow: Or IS he??
25/05/90
Calvin! What are you doing home?! Its not even noon! Uh they let us out early today. There was um a gas leak. WHAT?! Does anyone know you left?! Im calling the school. Dont waste your time! Everyone was evacuated! Theres nobody there! Hello? Elementary school office please. Our hero hadnt counted on running into a zark enforcer ship! Spiffs evasive maneuvers come to naught! This could be the end!
26/05/90
Boy I sure got in big trouble TODAY! Mom hit the roof when she found out I just left school. What happened? She drove me back and we had to talk to my teacher AND the principal! They talked about study habits and now Ive got extra homework! Ooh. And Dad is going to check it every night to make sure its done right! Can you believe it?! So try to do an extra good job now OK? Youre lucky tigers are so smart.
27/05/90
Im taking the umbrella outside. Well thats showing a little foresight for once. Good for you. Wait a minute. You really think this will work? Of course! Lets go! Smash! Bonk bonk bonk. Look! Im flying!! I had my eyes shut. How was it? Great! What a ride! Lets get some other kids and charge em!
28/05/90
UFOs! Are they real?? Have they landed in our towns and neighborhoods? Do the chilling photographs by an amateur photographer really show a sinister alien spaceship and the grim results of a close encounter or are the pictures an elaborate hoax? Listen to an expoert on space aliens speculate on their hideous biology and their horrifying weaponry! All this and more... ...on Calvins show and tell ... NEXT! Calvin will you come here please?
29/05/90
Twitching tufted tail a toasty tawny tummy: a tired tiger. ... an alliterative haiku by Calvin. Thank you thank you. Sheesh.
30/05/90
You know how people look at modern art and always say My 6-year old kid could do that!? Well that gave me this great idea! Ive decided to become a forger and get rich passing off fake paintings to museums! A lot of paintings sell for tens of millions of dollars now so I make a pretty good hourly rate. You should probably scratch out the copyright date on the cartoon stationery. Ooh yeah glad you caught that!
31/05/90
Once upon a time there was... Hold it. This story doesnt have any shoot-ups in it does it? You mean guns? No. Any violence at all? Um... not really. Any references to satanism? Any profanity? Any car chases? Any lewd parts? Of course not! What makes you think Ill like this?
01/06/90
Hey Mom want to see something great? With one sip from this ordinary can of soda I can burp for almost ten seconds straight! Calvin I dont... But thats not all! At the same time Ill also recite a gross limerick I learned at school! ...Ready? Maybe if you recited the Gettysburg addres... Forget it. My talents are wasted on her kind.
02/06/90
Well look whos up! Good morning sleepyhead! Youve missed the best part of the day! Ive been up since 6:30 getting many things accomplished! At least when I have a day off I can tell the difference. I just KNOW some nurse switched the bassinets.
03/06/90
Honey we have to leave soon. Is Calvin taking his bath? Oh good. While Im taking my bath you can brush your teeth and comb your hair. Right. Your dad wont mind if I use his cologne will he? Well go easy this time. Think I should shave? No go for the Don Johnson fuzzy look. Heres a tie and one of my sport coats. Perfect! Right out of GQ! boy I look good in anything dont I? Refresh my memory. How did I get talked into this one? My friend would like to see the wine list.
04/06/90
CLICK. Pander to me!
05/06/90
Playing a record? Ill show you something interesting. Compare a point on the label with a point on the records outer edge. They both make a complete circule in the same amount of time right? Yeah... but the point on the records edge has to make a bigger circule in the same time so it goes faster. See two points on one disk move at two speeds even though they both make the same revolutions per minute!
06/06/90
On your mark... get set... GO! IM going so slow Im moving BACKWARD! Im winning! Thats cheating!
07/06/90
Hello? Hi Dad! Calvin is this important? Oops. Wait. Foget I called you Dad OK? This isnt Calvin. Calvin Ive got work to do. Ill see you when I get home. OK? Goodbye. Wait! Do you have any crimes to report? Phooey. This secret identity stuff is hard to get used to.
08/06/90
Want to see something cool? Ive got a baby tooth thats just hanging by a thread... and I can turn it all the way around with my tongue... or make it swing from side to side! See? See? Theyre all just jealous.
09/06/90
LOOK! I dont see anything. You missed it. Well Im done. What did he see? An opportunity.
10/06/90
Wanna go catch some fish? Sure. Ugh. I dont want to touch these worms will you put one on my hook? Me? Im not gonna spear any worms. I know ... lets just dump the worms in the water and when the fish come up to eat them well catch them in the net! Pretty smart huh? Thats what I like about surviving in the wild ... pitting our wits against the raging elements! The worms are getting soggy. Ooh they are starting to sink. Bloop bloop bloop. Lets pit our wits against some fast food cheesburgers. Those come in neat little boxes. Yeah whod want to eat something that eats worms anyway?
11/06/90
I dont feel so good. You dont look so good. Let me feel your forehead. Summer vacation started! I cant be sick! Your heads hot. Ill get the thermometer. NO! I REFUSE! FORGET IT! I HATE THERMOMETERS! I still dont believe her that these things take two hours to register. Now be nice and quiet and Ill check on you this afternoon.
12/06/90
Ooh I itch! This is worse than bug bites! Whatever it is its driving me crazy! COOL!
13/06/90
Yep thats chicken pox all right. CHICKEN pox?! Mom what IS this guy? A veterinarian? The virus should run its course in about a week. Hes mad! MAD I say! Ill be the REAL doctor is tied up and gagged in the other exam room! Hes extremely contagious so keep him away from other kids. Sue him Mom! Drive his malpractice insurance up! Calvin has to be INSIDE for a WEEK?? Thats a nasty twitch youve developed. Hey Doc for 10 bucks Ill make sure you see those kids in the waiting room again real soon!
14/06/90
Hello? Hi Susie! Its me Calvin! I was wondering if youd like to come over and play. Why sure! Boy I dont think youve EVER invited me to... Calvin what are you doing? Nothing Mom. Go away. Youre contagious! You cant have anyone over to play! Shh! Shh! Youll spoil the whole thing! I was going to trick Susie into catching... hey! Let go! Ow! *CLICK* Any chance of getting transferred Dad?
15/06/90
Youre absolutely positive tigers cant catch chicken pox? Right. Youre absolutely POSITIVE tigers cant catch chicken pox? Go to bed Calvin.
16/06/90
See the chicken pox are going away. Thats good. Well just remember that this week doesnt count. Doesnt count? Right. Summer vacation days dont count if youre sick. I get to start school a week later now. So I get my full allotment of vacation. OK whats the NEXT amendment say? I know its in here someplace.
17/06/90
Weve got a baby sitter tonight. Ready? Ready. Calvin the baby sitter is here! Were going! Be good ok? Hi there. You must be Calvin. Hmmph. Youre not my mom. So I dont have to do anything you say. Im going to do whatever I feel like so just stay out of the way. Calvin take a look by the telephone and tell me what you see. A note Mom left with emergency numbers. Right. Now you wouldnt want me to have to call any of those numbers would you? Well. It must be 6:30. Guess Ill turn in. for eight bucks a night I dont put up with much.
18/06/90
Can I be excused? Theres a TV show I want to see. Were still eating dinner Calvin. IM through. This stuff was awful. I want to go watch television. Its impolite to leave the table in the middle of a meal. So what am I supposed to do? Just sit here and watch you guys chew?! Ill miss my show! Your TV show isnt as important as spending some time together as a family. Well compromise. Ill go watch a sitcom family. In a minute youre going to discover the difference between those and real life.
19/06/90
My TV show is starting. Im missing my show! Im sure your instinct for survival will kick in shortly. Whats the big deal about dinner?! Why cant I go watch TV? Lots of people watch TV while they eat! Calvin dinner is the one time during the day that we set aside to be together and talk. Theres more to being a family than just living in the same house. We need to interact once in a while. We could all argue over what channel to watch. You know what I mean.
20/06/90
Ive missed half of my TV show now. I hope youre happy. You shouldnt be planning your life around the TV anyway. Hmph. Look I dont think its too much to ask that we sit together for 40 minutes without distractions and interruptions. RINNGG! Ill get it! Im expecting a call. Go ahead Dad. I believe you were saying something funny. I have all these great genes but theyre recessive. THATS the problem here.
21/06/90
Cmon Hobbes we have to go outside. We HAVE to? Yeah Dad wont let me watch TV. He says its summer its light late and I should go run around instead of sitting in front of the tube. Can you believe it?! What a dictator. How cruel it is to be forced to play. ILL show him. I refuse to have fun.
22/06/90
OK next well race to that tree over there. THIS race will determine the championship of the universe. Oh... wait. How long have we been out here? I dunno. An hour maybe. Really? Geez. Where does time go?! Hang on Ill be right back. IM NOT HAVING FUN!
23/06/90
Its getting dark Calvin. Time to come in and go to bed! But Hobbes and I were catching fireflies. Cant we stay out a little longer? Ha! First you didnt want to go out and now you dont want to come in! See by not watching TV you had more fun and now youll have memories of something real you DID instead of something fake you just WATCHED. Nothing spoils fun like finding out it builds character.
24/06/90
Whats that smell? Either moms cooking dinner or somebody got sick in the furnace duct. Boy does it stink in here! What are you cooking for dinner?! Whatever it is Im not eating it. Im stewing some monkey heads. Monkey heads? Theyll be soggy enough to eat in about twenty minutes. Really?? Were having monkey heads! We are not ... are those really monkey heads? Ive never had monkey heads before! I wonder what theyre like. Wow! Monkey heads! Mm ... kinda squishy. Oow look is that a nose? Whats this? Brains? I didnt think theyd be so rubbery ... what? I thought these were stuffed peppers. Honey. What the heck is this?? Whatever it is Im not eating it!
25/06/90
Hop in Hobbes! Were going to get rich! Oh no Im not getting into that box. I dont want to be transmogrified or duplicated or whatever. What? When the TOP is open its a time machine remember? Even worse. Oh dont be such a baby. The way you act youd think the dinosaur actually GOT us last time. Why it wasnt even a carnivore. I dont care. You and that box are plain bad news.
26/06/90
Too bad youre not going back to the jurassic with me. An opportunity like this doesnt come along every day you know. The less often the better is what I say. Were just going on a photo safari! When we come back with REAL dinosaur photos well get rich! You can drop the we stuff. Im not going. OK well I guess Ill have to eat all these great snacks myself then. Snacks? What kind of snacks? Are they GOOD snacks? How many snacks did you bring?? Never mind! You said youre not going.
27/06/90
I guess if we get to have snacks it would be OK to time travel. If theyre GOOD snacks I mean. Great! Put on your vortex goggles. The dial is set for 140 million years ago. So OFF WE GO-O-O! I have a question. Why dont we get younger as we go back in time and disappear as we pass the day we were born? Id explain it but theres a lot of math. I thought you got a D in math.
28/06/90
Is it time for snacks yet? Hobbes were travelling at light speed through an interdimensional continuum lapse! Wait till we land! OK Ill just inventory the snacks and record them for the journal. You COULD help me drive you know! If we miss our exit we could fly right into the big bang! What would happen then? Thered be no universe and probably now time! I think we should eat the snacks NOW. Sit still will you? Youll make me swerve.
29/06/90
Theres a diplodocus! Were in the jurassic! We made it! Ugh. I cant believe you wanted to come back here. Last time we didnt bring a camera. All we need is a few good dinosaur photos and well be rich when we get home. If we get in National Geographic maybe Ill get to meet some of those tigress babes they showed in the April issue! Yow wow! Those were females? Really I dont know how you can even tell the difference.
30/06/90
Hey! Theres a chance to get some pictures of some stegosaurs! See these photos will answer hundreds of questions about dinosaur anatomy and behavior! Paleontologists will pay through their nose to see these! Take a picture of this one. Hes smiling. Just a minute. Just a minute.
01/07/90
No Earthling has ever before seen the cratered scarred surface of the distant planet Zog! ... although its not unlike some of those zit cream commercials ... we join the fearless Spaceman Spiff interplanetary explorer extraordinaire out at the farthest reaches of the galaxy ... with nerves of steel our hero sets forth on his dangerous mission! He fires his hyper-jets and ... blasts into the fifth dimension! Into a world beyond human comprehension! Into a world where time has no meaning! Man this class lasts forever! So we carry the three into the tens column ...
02/07/90
Whats THIS ugly brute called? AN ALLOSAUR! Im right here. You dont need to shout. RUN! When we get back to the time machine throw him the snacks we packed! Maybe that will diver him while we take off! You can throw YOUR snacks. I might still want mine. Youre going to be a snack yourself! Get in! Get in!
03/07/90
Quick! Thow him the food! My sandwich had mustard. Is this one yours? Put on your vortex goggles! Were taking off! Eww this banana is mushy. He can have THIS. We did it! Were off! Here. Boy that was a close call. Bit it will be worth it when we get these pictures developed. Since I rescued your sandwich can I eat it?
04/07/90
Hey Mom guess where Hobbes and I have been! I SAW where you were. You were playing in a cardboard box out back. Nope! Thats just what it LOOKED like. We time travelled to the jurassic but we returned at the split second we left! Thats why it didnt look like we were gone! We saw lots of dinosaurs! Well youve had a productive morning then. Yeah. Will you take this film to be developed? Ill pay you back
05/07/90
Hobbes look! We got our pictures back from our jurassic trip! Oh boy! Lets see! Wow these came out good! Look at that apatosaur! Theres me! Theres me! Yes! Yes! Were RICH! Ha ha! Now we can get our own apartment! This dinosaur blinked. Ill buy a car too but since I cant drive for another decade well have to get a chauffeur. If we pay him he has to let us sit up front and beep the horn right?
06/07/90
Well Dad its too bad you werent any nicer to me all these years. Beg pardon? Yep I cant say Im particularly including to share my future millions with you. Here look. Dinosaurs? Hobbes and I went to the jurassic today and came back with these dramatic photographs! Were going to be rich. I didnt realize dinosaurs looked so small and plastic. HEY WHAT ARE YOU INSINUATING?!
07/07/90
Dad doesnt believe we went to the jurassic and took photographs of real dinosaurs. He says it looks like we just put my toy models in the yard and took pictures of THEM! He says our get-rich-quick scheme wont work. Huh! He said if we REALLY wanted to get some money hed pay us a dollar to pull weeds out of the front walk. Just a dollar? Of course I told him we didnt want the money THAT bad.
08/07/90
Wap! Thok! Poom. Wunk. Nice double play. Whos out? It depends are you on my team or am I on your team?
09/07/90
Hey Mom if we were cannibals what parts of people would we eat? What? You know where would the steaks be? Would legs be like drumsticks? Would kids be like veal? Ughh! Go be disgusting somewhere else! Out! Some people just dont have inquisitive minds.
10/07/90
Ever notice how the older people get the slower they do things? I wonder why that is. I would think that the less life you had left the faster youd want to do everything so you could pack more into the remaining years. You can bet when Im a geezer like Dad Ill be going like a maniac. Oh great.
11/07/90
Better hurry. Your Moms yelling something.
12/07/90
Easy... easy now... thats it... Steady boy... easy... nice bike... AUGH! PHPPBT!
13/07/90
Wow what happened to YOU?? That darn bicycle tried to killme! You fell off? It took me 40 minutes to subdue it to the point where I could climb on and then it bucked me right over the handlebars! You fell off. THEN it tried to run me over! Its out to kill me! Im lucky to be alive! Well balancing takes a little practice. Do you have a rifle? Will you shoot it?
14/07/90
Maybe we should get your inner ear checked.
15/07/90
Calvin quit horsing around! Hobbes is crowding me. This is my half of the seat. Got it stripeypants? That is your side! You stay over there! I see that!! Calvin Im trying to concentrate be quiet. Hobbes poked me. I dont care what Hobbes did! Just be quiet until we get out of this traffic. Hee hee! Stop it you heard Dad! Hoo hoo! Gkpthb! Were going to get in trouble. Mmp mp! Hee hee! Hee hoo ha hee ha ha! Calvin! I thought I said I wanted it quiet!! We were having a weird face contest Dad. But were all through now. You won.
16/07/90
Hi Calvin! What are you doing down there? SHH! SHH! Get down! Be quiet! Have you seen my bicycle? No... Thank goodness. If my bike doesnt get me first Im going to cit all its spokes in two. You never saw me today got it? Our class voted Calvin the Most likely to be seen on the news some day.
17/07/90
Want some oil? See? Nice oil? Wouldnt you like some? Easy... Easy... Rrrr YAA! I got you now! Youre going to the scrap heap you rabid pile of rusty AAH OW WHOA DOWN! I NEVER got MY face caught in the chain when I learned to ride a bike. Really how did this happen? I TOLD you! Ow!
18/07/90
That stupid bicycle! I hate it! Im never going to ride one as long as I live. CREEAAKK W-whats that? AUGHH! MY BICYCLE HAS BEEN LYING IN WAIT! ITS COMING TO GET ME! HELP! HELP! S-see? Its trying to k-kill me! It was just a dream honey. ...but why on earth did you bring your bike upstairs to your closet?
19/07/90
Calvin will you take this to the garbage can in the garage please? The GARAGE?? Are you mad? I WILL be if you dont hop to it. But thats where my killer bicycle is! I cant go out there! Itll jump me! I dont want any nonsense. Just do what I asked OK? Rrrr. I wonder how far from this house my savings would get me.
20/07/90
Psst! Hobbes! What are you doing up there? Hiding from my killer bicycle. It cant climb trees so I guess Ill stay here for the rest of my life. You should just wedge a big stick through the spokes of the front wheel. That way when the stick hits the fork the wheel will jam and the bike will flip over. Hey thats a GREAT idea! Hobbes youre a lifesaver! We could mosey over to the kitchen if youre wondering how you can possibly thank me enough.
21/07/90
I did it Hobbes! I put a stick in the spokes of my killer bicycle! When it tried to chase me it flipped over! I wrestled it to exhaustion and then I let the air out of its tires! Ha! I guess that nasy ol thing wont be coming after me any more! Were too smart for it! Man triumphs over machine! Training wheels! What a good idea! I pumped up his tires too. They were both flat.
22/07/90
Guess whats short and ugly and wet all over! ... give up? The answer had better not be what I think it is ... squirt squirt squirt squirt! Yow! Squirt squirt squirt squirt! Bang bonk bing! Calvin! If youre going to tear around do it outside!! Okay okay ...
23/07/90
A toast to us! To us! Best friends forever! Right! CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH
24/07/90
Hi Dad. I suppose youre wondering how youre doing in the polls. Not really. I think youll find THIS chart quite revealing. This line represents the Average Dad approval rating of 70%. This overlay shows YOUR approval rating at just under 10%! Household six-year-olds were polled on their favourite bedtimes. Watch on these successive overlays how your rating would improve with each hour later! See by midnight youre right up to normal! These findings suggest a logical course of action. How long do you spend making these charts?
25/07/90
My tiger it seems is running round nude. This fur coat must have made him perspire. It lies on the floor - should this be construed as a permanent change of attire? Perhaps he considers its colors passe or maybe it fit him too snug. Will he want it back? Should I put it away? Or use it right here as a rug? Z. I wonder when school starts.
26/07/90
People dont understand me. They dont realize Im a card-carrying genius. You have a card? Oh absolutely. See it says Calvin certified genius. Wow you have a certificate? Well not really but no one every checks those things. I just say its at the frame shop. Pretty smart. Im a genius. How did you emboss this card? With a screwdriver?
27/07/90
AAHH! How am I supposed to learn surgery if I cant dissect anything?
28/07/90
You know what cracks me up? Ants RUN everywhere! Its like they all think they have to be somehwere on time! See they never walk or poke along. They go everywhere at top speed! Isnt that silly? Cmon around back. Ill show you something else!
29/07/90
Its another new morning for Mr. Monroe. He glances at the newspaper headlines over a cup of coffee and gets in his red sports car to go to work. Little does he realize its his last day on the face of the earth! Calvin drinks the magic elixer and begins an incredible transformation. Instantly he grows! Bigger and bigger! Higher and higher! He is now over 300 feet tall! The formula is a success! Calvin the mighty giant goes on a terrible rampage striking fear into the hearts of the populace! Nothing can stop him! Its panic in the streets! A town lies in ruins! No I wont buy you any more toy cars. I saw you! You deliberately stomped on those!
30/07/90
With a distant rumbling great thunder clouds pile high into the sky! Suddenly theres a blinding flash of light! Its Calvin the lightning bolt! In a fraction of a second the house below will be in a million pieces! I know its raining out but play a board game or something.
31/07/90
Every day its the same old thing. ... but not today! Everybodys a slave to routine.
01/08/90
Can I get some contact lenses? Your eyes are fine! You dont need contacts. Yes I do! They have some that change the color of your eyes! Your eyes are very pretty the way they are. But if I had contacts I coul dmake one eye blood red and the other yellow striped like a bug. I dunno it seems like once people grow up they have no idea whats cool.
02/08/90
Geez I gotta have a REASON for everything?!
03/08/90
Boy when its THIS hot I dont want to do anything at all! Fortunately that was our plan from the start.
04/08/90
ME TARZAN! KING OF THE JUNGLE! THUMP THUMP. Nice underpants. Does your Mom know youre over here like this? I dont think Jane EVER said that to Tarzan.
05/08/90
Hey mom are you nervous? No ... why? Calvin go outside and quit bugging me! Calvin the bug buzzes off! Flying low over the grass he searches for dead meat! Up and over the flowers darting this way and that! Oh no! hes caught in a spider web! Thrashing about in a desperate bid for freedom he only becomes more entangled! Soon the spider will suck out his innards! Help! I was going to join you in the hammock but I think Ill forget it.
06/08/90
Dont you get hot wearing long pants in summer? Why dont you wear short pants? Whats the matter? What did I say? SHORT PANTS TOUCH MY FEE OK?!!
07/08/90
Aw Mom you act like Im not even wearing a bungie cord!
08/08/90
WAP! BONK Gosh were BOTH out!
09/08/90
Oh boy! Cooked-out hamburgers! They may be charred on the outside! They may be raw on the inside! But at least theyve got that special outdoor flavor! ... of lighter fluid! MM-MM when do we eat? Whaddaya mean tomorrow?!
10/08/90
I like toys that make a lot of racket. Thats the problem with this wagon. It doesnt make much noise. AIEEEE! AUGH! WHOAA! OOMPH! OOH! Fortunately WE do.
11/08/90
YAAH! Oops. He just does that to show he COULDVE snuffed me.
12/08/90
Go on three ok? One ... Two ... Two and a half ... Ready ... Set ... Go! Pit Pat Pit Pat Pit Pat Pit Pat. Pittida Dittida Pittida Dittida. Chooga Chooga Chooga. Eeewyeeowww. Gasp. I cant believe it! No sonic boom! Not even a pop! I heard a pop. But I think it was my lungs.
13/08/90
Do you support the free expression of ideas in our society? Sure. Thats first on our bill of rights. So you would be against censorship and suppression of ideas you found distasteful. Right. Youve got to take the bad with the good. So you wouldnt object to me being exposed to art movies or music that some people think is offensive and shocking right? OK first let me explain about our responsibility to be culturally educated and able to MAKE critical distinctions about... YOUR STALLLLING!
14/08/90
Hmmmm rub rub rub GRR SNARLL Hmmmm rub rub rub
15/08/90
Sometimes I feel like our life has gotten too complicated... that weve accumulated more than we really need... that weve accepted too many demands... Well Thoreau says Simplify Simplify. Maybe thats what we need to do. But how? I hate it when they look at me that way.
16/08/90
Hello? Hi Dad! Its me Calvin. Calvin unless this is REALLY important hang up OK? Im very busy. OK Dad. Goodbye. This should qualify in another 15 minutes.
17/08/90
Calvin I asked you to clean up your room. I DID! Well you didnt do a very good job then. It looks as messy as it did before. You should take pride in what you do and always do the best job possible. I dont need to do a better kob. I need better P.R. on the job I DO.
18/08/90
Huhh UHH! I wouldnt be worried about this if he was a better student.
19/08/90
Wanna toss the ol pigskin around? Heck no. Phooey. The center snaps the ball! The quarterback looks for an opening! The defense disintegrates beneath the coming onslaught! The quarterback jumps and dodges! Hobbes breaks clear! Calvin passes! An amazing catch! Hobbes is at the 30 ... the 20 ... the 10 ... but hes tackled from behind and laterals to Calvin so he can make the touchdown! But Calvin fumbles the ball and Hobbes recovers it! But a penalty is called on the play and Hobbes is sent to the bench! Hobbes defects to the other team and is greeted with enthusiastic cheers! The crowd goes wild! Calvin prepares to cripple the traitor with an illegal face mask pull! Hobbes defies him by pouring out of his mouth guard onto Calvin helmet! Boy you can see why football is such a violent game! Hobbes team gains a yard! All the cheerleaders come out for smooches!!
20/08/90
This meeting of top-secret club GROSS (Get Rid Of Slimy Girls) will come to order supreme ruler and dictator-for-life Calvin presiding! Hear hear! President and first tiger Hobbes will now provide us with an attendance report. All present and accounted for sir! Excellent! Now club secretary general Hobbes will review the minutes. Its 10:32. Thank you. At this time well have a field report from top scout Calvin! You can tell this is a great club because we have so many officers.
21/08/90
Herewith a field report filed from head scout Calvin! What news scout? The enemy has been sighted on the sidewalk two doors down Mr President. The enemy? Susie Derkins an acknowledged GIRL! I recommend we establish a strike force? Its objective? To bug her! Sounds risky. Men any volunteers?
22/08/90
OK heres our plan. Ill be the strike force commander. Youll be the special agend in charge of munitions. Well fill up a water balloon and sneak up on Susie through the back yard! I get to be the official cartographer and map our hiding places and escape routes! Yeah! And ILL be the code expert and make an unbreakable code! Oh boy! Lets get some paper! I hope Susie doesnt go anyplace for a while. OK heres the United States...
23/08/90
There! I finished our secret code! Lets see. I assigned a totally random number so that code will be hard to crack. For letter A you write 3004572688. B is 28731569 1/2. Thats a good code all right. Now we just commit this to memory. Did you finish your map of our neighbourhood? Not yet. How many bricks does the front walk have?
24/08/90
Weve got our map our code and our water balloon! Lets go soak Susie! Our map says first we run to the big tree out back. Now to the bush out front! Now to the ditch out back! Now to the tree out front! In case youre wondering - this is to lose anyone who might be tailing us. Im writing a message in code. How do you spell nincompoop?
25/08/90
We made it to Susies yard! But wheres Susie? I dont see her! ARGHH! We go to all this trouble to launch an attack on her and what does she do? She MOVES! All our great plans are for naught! A whole morning ruined! Maybe she just went in for lunch see she left some of her toys out so shes probably planning to come back. That gives me a FABULOUS idea! Uh oh.
26/08/90
Gravity is arbitrary! Calvin wakes up one day to find he is immune to the force of gravity. He hangs on to the ground for dear life but his grip is weakening! He cant hold on! He ... he lets go! Aaaaa. Higher and higher as upward he falls! Only by grabbing the tail pin of a passing jet does Calvin save himself from being hurled out into space! No no let him finish. This is very interesting so after you landed in Phoenix what happened? Well I dont care. Im not sewing velcro on the outside of all his clothes. Well about then my gravity came back so I ...
27/08/90
What are you doing? Thats Susies doll. I know. Cmon lets scram. We cant take her doll! That would be STEALING! No it wouldnt. Are we going to give it back? If she pays the ransom.
28/08/90
Hey wheres Binky Betsy? I know I left her right here when I went inside. Did somebody TAKE her? Everything else is still here. Where did my doll go?! IF YOU WANT TO SEE YOUR DOLL AGAIN I always like cut-and-paste. How much should we ask for? A hundred dollars?
29/08/90
Mom I cant find my doll. Have you seen it anywh... DING DONG Hmm theres nobody here. Whats this note? Susie if you want to see your doll again leave $100 in this envelope by the tree out in front. Do not call the police. You cannot trace us. You cannot find us. Sincerely Calvin.
30/08/90
Its a RANSOM note! That dirty Calvin stole my doll and he wants me to pay $100 to get her back! Of all the nerve! He cant get away with this! Why that stinky little... Wait! Theres something else in this envelope. A PHOTO OF BINKY BETSY TIED TO A CHAIR!! What a great club! How are you going to spend YOUR $50?
31/08/90
Lets stroll down the sidewalk REAL CASUALLY and see if Susie put the hundred bucks out by the tree yet. Great! Lovely day for a stroll eh Hobbes? I certainly enjoy my afternoon constitutional! Yes its quite invigorating! Look! Look! Theres the envelope! She did it! Were rich! Oh boy! Lets sneak up and get it! Cmon you louse. Cmonnn... I dont see Susie. Do you?
01/09/90
You stand guard and watch for Susie while I count the money and make sure its all there! Hey theres no money in here at all! Theres just a note! It says Now were even! Now were even?? Whats THAT supposed to mean?! Hobbes? HOBBES!
02/09/90
Do you think boogeymen really exist? I dont know. ... but if they do Im sure this is where they live. That was the creepiest campfire story Ive ever heard. Lets get back to the tent! I dont think Ill ever sleep again. Shh! What? Did you hear something?? Didnt you? I dont know. What did it sound like? Sort of like breathing and drooling and ripping the meat off human bones. Yaahhhh. You were right. Im glad we carried a generator all this distance.
03/09/90
COME BACK HERE WITH HOBBES! PUT HIM DOWN! HOBBES BITE HER! BITE HER! Ha ha! Nyahh! Nyahh! SLAM GET AWAY FROM OUR DOOR WITH THAT DRILL!
04/09/90
Oooh that rotten Susie! I hate her! I hate her! Shed better set Hobbes free! So I kidnapped her stupid doll! She didnt need to RETALIATE! Cant she take a JOKE?! Girls have NO sense of humor! Thats their whole problem! All this was funny until she did the same thing to me.
05/09/90
All right Susie I brought your dumb doll back! Now let Hobbes out OK? Fairs fair! I dunno Calvin. Im thinking I might rather have your tiger. You can keep Binky Betsy. Aahh! I dont want a DOLL! This is yours! Take it! Oh youll grow to like her Calvin. She has the cutest accessories you can buy! No! No! I want Hobbes! Take this! But I think Hobbes likes it better here with ME. HE DOES NOT!
06/09/90
Look Susie Ill give you your doll AND Ill give you a quarter OK? Its all I have. Will you let Hobbes out NOW?? All right here. And next time leave my stuff alone. Got it? Right! Sure! Jerk. What kind of tiger ARE you?! You didnt even maul her! What were you DOING there?! Wouldnt YOU like to know!
07/09/90
Ive got to say Hobbes it doesnt give our club a lot of credit when the First Tiger is a willing captive of the enemy. THBPTB We stole HER doll and Im the one who had to pay ransom! Its a disgrace! You get 15 demerits for besmirching the clubs reputation plus five demerits for conduct unbecoming an officer and a censure in the book club for not devouring Susie when you had the chance. Hmm anything else? I almost told her our code when she rubbed my tummy. GOOD GRAVY WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?!
08/09/90
Well this is certainly a sorry chapter in G.R.O.S.S. history! First tiger Hobbes a traitor to the cuase! It might interest you to know that after I won Susies confidence I did some spying. Spying? You were a spy? I read an open page of Susies diary. Wow! Deep in enemy territory you intercepted a secret message? What did it say? It said Calvin is a pig-faced smelly fat-head! Then our club is a success! Brilliant work Hobbes! Promotions for everyone! Welcome back!
09/09/90
Spaceman Spiff is hit! Hes going down! Fortunately our hero always buckles up! The fearless Spaceman Spiff has crashed on a distant world! The planets atmosphere is thick with noxious fumes and gases! Our hero can hardly breathe. Spiff must find help quickly ... but is there any life on this hostile world? His question is answered when a hideous blob of of gelatinous muck oozes out of a crevice toward him! Spiffs blaster is useless against the slime! Our hero tries to escape but the suffocating stench envelops him! What a disgusting fate! Yechh! I sure wish Id brought my lunch today! Thats gross Calvin! If you dont like the cafeterias tapioca just leave it alone!
10/09/90
Help me with this homework OK? Whats 6+3? 6+3 eh? Well this one is a bit tricky. First well call the answer Y as in Y do we care? Now Y may be a square number so well draw a sqare and make this side 6 and that side 3. Then well measure the diagonal. I dont remember the teacher explaining it like this. She probably doesnt know higher math. When you deal with high numbers you need higher math. But this diagonal is just a little under two. OK here Ill draw a bigger square.
11/09/90
Hey no comic books until you finish your homework. I DID finish. That didnt take very long. Did you do a good job? I did a GREAT job. When youre as far ahead of the class as I am it doesnt take much time. Well see about that when I get back from my parent-teacher conference with Miss Wormwood. Youre going to talk to my teacher? Im sure it will be an informative meeting. Gosh I forgot to tell you! Miss Wormwood said I was so good you didnt need to bother coming really! She said you dont have to go!
12/09/90
Oh man! Mom went to a parent-teacher conference! Im as good as dead. Miss Wormwood will tell Mom all sorts of horror stories about me! Horror stories? Well its a question of perspective. Still I think I should be allowed to have a lawyer present at the meeting. What are you going to say when your Mom gets back? Nothing. Nothing at all? Buddy if you think Im even going to BE here youre crazy!
13/09/90
Im home. How was your meeting with Calvins teacher? Well when we got to the classroom we saw that all the kids had drawn self-portraits in the art class and had left the pictures on their desks so the parents would recognize their childs seat. Thats a cute idea. Did you find Calvins picture? There was one drawing of a green kid with fangs six eyes and a finger up his nose. Uh oh. The meeting went downhill from there.
14/09/90
Calvin I... YIKE!! Youre home! I didnt even finish pack... that is um... LIES! Everything Miss Wormwood said about me was a lie! She just doesnt like me! She hates little boys! Its not MY fault! IM not to blame! She told you about the noodles right? It wasnt me! Nobody saw me! I was framed! I wouldnt do anything like that! Im innocent I tell you! What noodles? Oh... Uh... Ha ha! Did I say noodles? You must have heard wrong. I didnt say noodles.
15/09/90
OK Calvin lets check over your math homework. Lets not and say we did. Your teacher says you need to spend more time on it. Have a seat. More time?! I already spent ten whole minutes on it! Ten minutes shot! Wasted! Down the drain! Youve written here 8+4=7. Now you know thats not right. So I was off a little bit. Sue me. You cant ADD things and come out with LESS than what you started with! I can do that! Its a free country! Ive got my rights!
16/09/90
Quit squirming Calvin. Youve got ice cream all over your shirt. Rats I was saving it for later. Thanks for the ice cream Dad. It was great. Youre welcome. Im tired of pulling you. Its my turn to ride. Your Dad didnt get me any ice cream so I get to ride both ways. No you dont! Dad said tigers dont like ice cream! Its my turn to ride! Tigers dont know if they like ice cream until they try every kind. Im not pulling. Ive got news fuzz brain. Im not pulling either! Well then I guess well both just sit here until we die. Why do these walks always end up as rides? oh you need the exercise more anyway.
17/09/90
Lets start at the beginning. When you ADD something you INCREASE what you have. You COMBINE. I dont want to learn this! Its completely irrelevant to my life! This isnt irrelevant. Everyone needs to know this. I dont! I can get along fine without math! Oh yeah? What do you want to be when you grow up? Every job requires SOME math. Thats not true! Ill be a... a... a caveman! Yeah! Thats not really a job.
18/09/90
Here maybe this will make more sense. I have eight pennies. I ask you for four more. I say forget it. Youre the one with a steady paycheck. Just give me four pennies. Good. How much money do I have now? Investments and all? No just here on the table. Eight cents. No eight plus four is twelve. See? Count them up. But those four are MINE!
19/09/90
Hows the math lesson going? Pretty good. I think Calvin sees the idea now. I took pennies and showed how adding and subtracting them changed how much money he had. Its not so abstract that way. Good. Maybe hell do better in class now. I think he will. He was having fun with it by the end. Now give me ANOTHER five cents and lets see what I have! Wait a minute.
20/09/90
Boy I feel sharp! I know this math stuff COLD! Im ready for anything! I hope the teacher calls on me! I hope I get to demonstrate a problem at the board! Ill impress everyone! Here Susie. Take one sheet and pass the rest across. Whats this? A math quiz. HOT DOG!
21/09/90
Dont try to copy my answers this time Calvin or Ill tell. Ha! Who needs YOUR answers? Ill bet I get a better score than you do. YOU?! Thatll be the day! Ill bet you 25 cents I get a higher grade. Youre on. You might as well give me the quarter now and save yourself the humiliation later! Maybe youd like to increase the wager Mr Bigmouth. Yeah! Lets double it and make it 35 cents!
22/09/90
Man this is going to be great! Not only am I going to ace this quiz but Im going to win a quarter from Susie when I get a better score than she does! OK! The first problem is 6+5. Oh easy! The answer is... um.... ummmmmmm... UMMMMMMMM His spacecraft quietly humming the incredible Spaceman Spiff approaches the sixth plant of the Mysterio system!
23/09/90
Im hungry whens lunch? Right now. Hi Susie! Oh look youve got your stuffed tiger! Can I squeeze him? What are you crazy? Hobbes is a ferocious man-eating jungle beast! Ferocious? He looks fuzzy and cuddly to me! Ha! Beneath that soft exterior lie terrible mandibles of bone crushing death! Hell grind you into hamburger! Each mighty paw hides razor-sharp claws to rip the living hide off any human that wanders too close! Hes a monster! No hes not. Hes a big cutie. Oh no! I cant look!! ... so what happened to the mandibles of death. You sissy furball?!? I was beguiled by her feminine charms. Yow. Go soak your head.
24/09/90
A small red spacecraft breaks through the cloud cover of Mysterio system planet 6! At the controls its none other than our fearless hero Spaceman Spiff! Piloting over the lifeless world he reflects on his unusual mission... QUIZ 1. 6+5= ... to somehoe crash planets 6 and 5 together!
25/09/90
In a scientific mission to discover what happens when two planets collide Spaceman Spiff drops anchor! The anchor catches on a hillside! Spiff downshifts and guns the motor! Imperceptibly at first the planet slowly moves towed along by our hero until... ...breaking orbit planet 6 picks up speed hurling towards planet 5!
26/09/90
Pulled by Spaceman Spiff planet 6 is about to collide with planet 5! With no time to lose our hero cuts loose the anchor and flies to safety! The planets crash grinding and shattering with awful force! Planet 5 being smaller is crunched to dust! Only 6 remains! 6+5=6. Time! Pass your papers forward. TIME?! I just finished the first problem!
27/09/90
How can our time be up?! I just did the first problem on this quiz! Where did the time go?? Guess! Guess! Pick random numbers! Maybe a few will be right by sheer luck! 15! 104! 3! 27! Hand it in Calvin. Your times up. SIGHHHH. Dont forget we have a bet on who gets the higher grade. The bets off! I dont gamble! No bets!
28/09/90
I got a perfect score on my quiz. You got a perfect score? What did YOU get? If you missed any you owe me 25 cents. I ran out of time! Id have had a perfect score too if Id had a few more minutes! What did you get? Its biological! Girls mature faster than boys! You just got a better grade because youre a girl! Its not fair! Pay up. Maybe its opposite day! Maybe all these Xs mean that my answers are correct! Maybe your A is really an F! That must be it! I win the bet!
29/09/90
How did you do on your math quiz? I flunked it... but only because I ran out of time. The worst part though was that Susie Derkins won our bet on whod get the better score. I had to pay her 25 cents. But get this! I cheated her! I only gave her three dimes! Ha! I think youre better study harded. Oh now dont YOU start on me.
30/09/90
Now where did all the bed pillows go? This is gonna be soft! Krunch! Hey Hobbes! Cmon and jump in the leaves! Its fun! I dont know sometimes slugs hide under leaves. No they dont. Do they? Slugs? Ugh just imagine one of those slimy muckballs slipping up your pant leg! There might be dozens in there! There might? Aack ick ooh yecch! Thats the problem with nature. Somethings always stinging you or oozing mucous on you. Lets go watch TV. Is it 3 oclock yet? We can watch The Blob!
01/10/90
Look Hobbes I cut a piece of cardboard to make a TV screen. See I just hold it up like Im on TV. Wow your own show! Too bad I cant really force my way into millions of peoples homes each day. But on the other hand no one ine THIS home can turn me off!
02/10/90
So whats it like being on TV? Its great! Now that Im on television Im different from everybody else! Im famous! Important! Since everyone knows me everything I do now is newsworthy. Im a cultural icon. I think your antenna needs adjusting. Watch Ill use my prestige to endorse a product!
03/10/90
Hi Im Calvin eminent television personality here to tell you about new improved Chocolate frosted sugar bombs! I love em! Theyre crunchy on the outside chewy on the inside and they dont have a single natural ingredient or essential vitamin to get in the way of that rich fudgy taste! Mm-mm! Yes kids youll like em so much you wont be able to sit still! Remember! Its the cereal I get paid to recommend because Im famous! What do you think? Are you filled with the desire to emulate me and eat the cereal I endorse? If not I can repeat this every 20 minutes. Dont you threaten ME.
04/10/90
Hi Mom! Ive got my own TV show! Thats nice. Hes Ca-a-alvin! Amazing great Ca-a-alvin! Oh hes the one that youd like to meet! Hes the one who just cant be beat! Hes ca-a-alvin! La data da daaaaa! Thank you! Thank you! Boy what an audience! Thank you! Please! Ha ha! No really sit down! Thank you! Thank you! Im changing the channel OK? Sorry Im on all the networks.
05/10/90
Wheres your TV screen? My fall lineup got cancelled. Dad said one TV in the house was bad enough and he preferred the one with the volume control. Maybe you should go cable. Ive got an idea for a sit-com called Father knows zilch.
06/10/90
What a rip-off! They say if you connect these dots you get a picture. But look! I did it and its just a big mess! I think youre supposed to connect them in the order that theyre numbered. Oh. Everythings gotta have rules rules rules!
07/10/90
... so if you capture the other guys flag and make it back to your territory you win. Win what? The game. No luggage? No toaster oven? Hey you cant hide your flag in a tree! Its too hard to capture! Thats not a rule. I can hide my flag anywhere! Well its a rule now! From now on no flags in trees! Ok but I just tagged you so you have to go to jail. What?? Its a time out! I was making a new rule! You didnt officially call a time out. Off to jail with you! Forget it! From now on if you are discussing a new rule its automatically a time out. Ok time in! Tag! You cant do that! We have to say time in together! Since when?? Youre just changing rules so youll win! I am not! Im just trying to keep you from cheating! Just a minute. Muffin head. Are you calling me a cheater? Whos a muffin head! Yowp! Arrgh! Oatmeal face! Strudel brain! Mom says we should take up Monopoly. No way buster. I know all about those interest free bank loans to yourself!
08/10/90
33... 27... 18... HIKE! AUGHH! Its clear Ill never have a career in sports until I learn to suppress my survival instinct. Touchdown!
09/10/90
What this game needs are negotiated settlements.
10/10/90
How come YOURE the one who goes to work and not Mom? Well your Mom USED to go to work but once you came along someone had to stay home. Your Moms job had a lot of stress and aggravation see ... and she wanted to quit? No shed gotten used to it so we figured she should be the one to... HEY!
11/10/90
Get off the swing or Ill punch your lights out. What a sissy! Haw! Years from now when Im successful and happy ... and hes in prison... I home Im not too mature to gloat.
12/10/90
Give me a nice smile. Thats good. Now dont make a face OK? Ready? One... two... thre... click. Click. *click*
13/10/90
Oh great altar of passive entertainment... bestow upon my thy discordant images at such speed as to render linear thought impossible!
14/10/90
Enemy sighted! Battle stations! Battle stations! Alert! Ahwooga! Heres the mighty aircraft carrier! Equipped with the latest radar and firepower. It is virtually unsinkable! I know what can sink it. Yeah? What? A cannonball depth charge!! Oh no! Pfoom! Ha ha! That was great! You emptied the whole tub! Turn on the water and lets do it again! We seem to have a waterfall down the stairway dear. Ill go see what your kid is doing. My did?!? Cmere and let me explain something to you ...
15/10/90
Here it is 8:00 and we have to go to bed already. Somebodys always running my life. I never get to do what I want to do. What would you do if you could stay up? I dunno... something FUN! Whatever Mom and Dad get to do!
16/10/90
That cloud of stars is our galaxy the milky way. Our solar system is on the edge of it. We hurl through an incomprehensible darkness. In cosmic terms we are subatomic particles in a grain on an infinite beach. I wonder whats on TV now.
17/10/90
Everyone takes me for granted! Nobody pays any attention to my needs! Is it too much to ask for an occassional token gesture of appreciation?! OK how about a big hug? Could I have 20 dollars? See?! I dont matter to anyone! Nobody cares about me!
18/10/90
Hobbes do you think our morality is defined by our actions or by whats in our hearts? I think our actions SHOW whats in our hearts. I RESENT THAT!
19/10/90
They say winning isnt everything and Ive decided to take their word for it.
20/10/90
I STAND FIRM IN MY BELIEF OF WHATS RIGHT! I REFUSE TO COMPROMISE MY PRINCIPLES! I dont NEED to compromise my principles because they dont have the slightest bearing on what happens to me anyway.
21/10/90
Bang! Kapwinngg! Bang bang! You missed! You missed! There he goes! After him boys! Giddyap! Giddyap! Ambush! Bang! Bang! Yow! Whoop! Bang! Gotcha! Noyadidnt! Noyadidnt! Calvin will you please stop tearing around the house?! Youre driving me crazy! You said we couldnt go outside because its raining. Boy that sure worked. Were not allowed back in until when?
22/10/90
Vroom vrooom rrr! Vroom vroooom AUGHH! I wouldnt mind this so much if he didnt keep a log. Would you say you were very surprised or COMPLETELY surprised?
23/10/90
Look Mom I made a mask. Are you getting ready for Haloween? Huh? No this is for every day. You know how Hobbes always sneaks up from behind and pounces on me? No... Well he does. But if you wear a mask like this on the back of your head tigers cant tell which way youre facing and they cant sneak up. I think your train of thought is a runaway. I read they wear these in India. Here I made a mask for you too.
24/10/90
Here Dad. I made you a mask like mine. You wear it on the back of your head to prevent tiger attacks. Um... Tigers always try to get you from behin but with this mask on they cant tell which way youre facing so they dont pounce. I read it in a book. Well I appreciate your concern but I think Ill take my chances and not look like a lunatic. OK if youd rather look like raw hamburger be my guest. Honey are we out of aspirin again?
25/10/90
Well if it isnt ol rocket-butt! I guess you wont be pouncing on ME any more! See Im wearing a mask on the back of my head! Now you cant tell which way Im facing so you cant sneak up from behind! Ive finally thwarted your murderous recreation! Maybe this will teach you that PEOPLE are smarter than ANIMALS! You cant outwit a human! No fair! You didnt even sneak up!
26/10/90
In the middle ages lords and vassals lived in a futile system. Thats feudal system. Just when I thought this junk was beginning to make sense.
27/10/90
Im a genius. I cant believe how smart I am. Ive got more brains than I know what to do with. So Ive noticed. Woo hoo hoo
28/10/90
A brilliant bolt of deadly frap ray blazes by the intrepid Spaceman Spiff! Our hero has very high insurance premiums. The courageous Spaceman Spiff is hit! He plummets toward planet Zog! Breaking through the cloud layer he careens over an alien city! Theres no place to land! Spiff wrestles the uncooperative controls! More freem drive to the thuster busters! Too much stress! The fuel explodes in flame! The situation is grim! Ten seconds to impact! Nine ... eight ... Well Calvin?? Seven! Very good Calvin. Ten minus three equals seven. I didnt think you were paying attention. That question was worth three points. Our hero miraculously makes a three-point landing. Spiff saves the day again!
29/10/90
Gimme that ball or Ill punch your face in. Smart move sissy boy. In my opinion we dont devote nearly enough scientific research to finding a cure for jerks.
30/10/90
Open wide... open wide... thats good... Now this might cause some slight discomfort... hold real still.... Rrgghh! Mmf! Rrg! Stop thrashing! Ive almost got it... almost... mmf! THERE! Boy its a good think you had this removed! Just look at all these bad spots! Lunch shouldnt have to be like this.
31/10/90
Take a look at this. Wouldnt you say this is a great drawing? I mean can you BELIEVE my teacher didnt like it? She said it wasnt serious! By golly if this isnt serious art then nothing is! Who set Miss Wormwood up as an arbiter of aesthetics anyway? This is a beautiful work of power and depth! Its a stegosaurus in a rocket ship right? See? YOU understood it!
01/11/90
On the one hand its a good sign for us artists that in this age of visual bombardment from all media a simple drawing can provoke and shock viewers. It confirms that images still have power. On the other hand my teachers reactionary grading shows that our society is culturally illiterate and that many people cant tell good art from a hole in the ground. This drawing I did obviously challenges the know-nothing complacency of those who prefer safe predigested bucolic genre scenes. My C- firmly establishes me on the cutting edge of the avante-garde. Dont you have to wear silly clothes then?
02/11/90
The hard part for us avante-garde post-modern artists is deciding whether or not to embrace commercialism. Do we allow our work to be hyped and exploited by a market thats simply hungry for the next new thing? Do we participate in a system that turns high art into low art so its better suited for mass consumption? Of course when an artist goes commercial he makes a mockery of his status as an outsider and free thinker. He buys into the crass and shallow values art should transcend. He trades the integrity of his art for riches and fame. Oh what the heck. Ill do it. That wasnt so hard.
03/11/90
Today I drew another picture in my Dinosaurs in Rocket Ships series and Miss Wormwood threatened to give me a bad mark in her grade book if I didnt stop! The arts are under attack! Freedom of expression is being squelched! The authoritie are trying to silence any view contrary to their own! What does your teacher object to about drawing dinosaurs? Mostly my drawing them during math.
04/11/90
Im ready for bed Dad. Whats tonights story going to be? Heres one Readings on Dialectical Metaphysics. Youll love it. Forget it Dad. You cant get me to drop off that easy. Will you read us this story? Hobbes wrote it himself. Hobbes wrote it huh? Goldilocks and the three tigers. Oh boy this is gonna be great! Once upon a time there lived a young girl named Goldilocks. She went into the forest and saw a cottage. No one was home so she went in. Inside she saw three bowls of porridge. A big bowl a medium bowl and a small bowl. She was just about to taste the porridge when the three tigers came home. They quickly divided Goldilocks into big medium and small pieces and dunked them in the porridge that ... Calvin Im not going to finish this! This is disgusting!! I dont know why I let you talk to me into this. Good night! Click. He didnt even look at our illustrations. Now Im all hungry.
05/11/90
Another gorgeous brisk fall day. What a waste to be going to school on a morning like this? What would you do if you could stay home this morning? Sleep right through it.
06/11/90
WHOA WHOAA WHOOOP BONK AHHHH! OOH! It COULDVE happened by accident!
07/11/90
Dont sit next to me Calvin. I dont want to hear any disgusting comments about lunch. Relax. I wont talk about lunch at all. Instead do you want to hear a riddle I made up? A riddle? OK. Whats the difference between a garden slug and a two-inch-long living booger? EWW!! I cant think of a difference either.
08/11/90
Get off the swing Twinky. Forget it Moe. Wait your turn. PUNCH! Its hard to be religious when certain people are never incinerated by bolts of lightning.
09/11/90
IM HOME! Theres no point in saving your lunch bags if you cant keep them cleaner than THIS! Thats what YOU think.
10/11/90
... tranquil Mt. Calvin... Suddenly with a shaking rumble he blows sky high! Hes a live volcano! Geysers of molten lava spray into the heavens! I TOLD you that chili sauce was hot! GLUG GLUG GLUG Yechh he spewed it all across the table!
11/11/90
Toboggans give better rides than runner sleds. Why is that? Theres no way to steer. On these cloudy winter days sometimes I like to lie back on my sled and look at the sky. Its just gray and silent. No birds singing or bugs buzzing. Everything is muffled by the snow. Imagine what it would be like without any people or houses around. It would be perfectly still. Pretty neat huh? Yes very peaceful. I hate all that silence.
12/11/90
Hello is your Dad there? No he isnt. OK will you write down my number and have him call me? Hold on. I need a pen. POW! AGHH! Ive been shot! I hate taking messages.
13/11/90
Mom do we have a shoe box I could have? Its for a school project. I think so. Lets see. Heres one. What are you going to do with it? Im supposed to make a diorama. Were studying the different ecosystems and Im going to make a desert scene. That sounds interesting. Ill need some glue and paper and stuff too. Im going to build a cactus and a roadrunner. When is this due? It was due today but I told the teacher I wasnt quite finished.
14/11/90
Wow Mom sure turned into the conniption queen when she found out I hadnt neve started my diorama project when it was already due today. So this is one day late! Whats the big deal?! Its not as if LIVES hang in the balance right? The fate of the universe doesnt depend on turning in a shoe box desert scene on time! Thats keeping things in perspective. Even if lives DID hang in the balance it would depend on whose they were.
15/11/90
This is hopeless! How am I supposed to create a desert scene in this shoe box when I dont even know what a desert looks like? IVE never been to a desert. Mom and Dad never take me anywhere fun on vacations! If theyd taken me to a desert sometime Id KNOW this stuff! Why dont you get out a book? And go to all that TROUBLE?! Yeah sure! Look Im a busy guy! Ive got other things to do with my life besides THIS you know! Right. Why waste time learning when ignorance is instantaneous? My TV show starts in 20 minutes. Are you going to help me or ont?
16/11/90
Mom where do we keep the papier-mache? We dont have any. Oh great! Just GREAT! How am I supposed to make a roadrunner without papier-mache?! Maybe you should have thought of that before 7:00 at night. Youll have to make one some other way. BUT HOW?! This is YOUR school project Calvin. YOU do the work. If I get a bad grade itll be YOUR fault for not doing the work for me!
17/11/90
Hows the diorama coming along? Im almost finished. That didnt take too long. Thats because Im a genius. I dont see the roadrunner. Werent you going to put one in? See the cotton balls I glued down? Yeah? The roadrunner just ran out of the scene leveing those clouds of dust!
18/11/90
Ha ha! Your clever little strategy has tragically backfired! Look at this jump! Watch and weep fuzz face! Thats your move right? I get to go now right? Its too late for you to change your mind right? Not so fast ... my hands still on it. Jump jump jump! I win! You win?!? Aaugghh! You won last time! I hate it when you win! Aarrggh! Mff! Gnnk! I hate this game! I hate the whole world!! Aghhh! What a stupid game! You must have cheated! You must have used some sneaky underhanded mind-meld to make me lose! I hate you! I didnt want to play this idiotic game in the first place! I know youd cheat! I knew youd win! Oh! Ooh! Aarg! Hack pant pant. Look its just a game. I know. You should see me when I loose in real life!
19/11/90
Youve never had an obligation an assignment or a deadline in all your life! You have no responsibilities at all! It must be nice! Wipe that insolent smirk off your face! The real fun of living wisely is that you get to be smug about it.
20/11/90
I hate doing this stuff! Its too much work. Why should I bother? Until you can stalk and overrun you cant devour anyone. I can see why tiger aphorisms dont catch on.
21/11/90
Live for the moment is MY motto. You never know how long youve got! You could step into the road tomorrow and WHAM - you get hit by a cement truck! Then youd be sorry you put off your pleasures! Thats why I say Live for the moment. Whats YOUR motto? Look down the road.
22/11/90
Ive decided I dont want to be famous. No? Nah. ANY idiot can be famous. I figure IM more the LEGENDARY type! Uh huh. Well I didnt mean right this second!
23/11/90
Can we burn these leaves? No that pollutes. But how can we appease the mighty snow demons if we dont sacrifice any leaves?! Well have a warm winter. I dont know whether your grasp of theology or meteorology is the more appalling. I guess Ill go light some candles around the toboggan and beg for mercy.
24/11/90
Do you think tigers go to the same heaven that people go to? I mean in heaven everyone is supposed to be HAPPY right? But people wouldnt be happy if they were always in danger of being eaten by tigers! On the other hand heaven wouldnt be very nice WITHOUT tigers either. I wouldnt be happy if there werent any tigers. Id miss them. Maybe tigers just dont eat people in heaven. But then WE wouldnt be happy.
25/11/90
Either hes playing classical music at 78 RMP or Im still dreaming. First thing tomorrow morning Im calling the orphanage.
26/11/90
Hey Dad Ill guess any number youre thinking of! Go ahead and pick a number! Mm... OK Ive got it. Is it 92376051? By golly it is! Wait a minute! Youre just trying to get RID of me arent you?! No youre psychic. Go show Mom.
27/11/90
A lot of people dont have principles but I do! Im a highly principled person! I live according to one principle and never deviate from it. Whats your principle? Look out for number one.
28/11/90
Mom you know the sandwich you packed for me today? Well by lunch time the jelly had soaked into the bread. That grosses me out. So tomorrow Id like the jelly put in a separate container with a knife so I can spread the jelly at the last possible moment before I eat the sandwich. Also you keep using the bread from the middle of the loaf. I only like those pieces for toast. For sandwiches I want only the end pieces because they dont absorb as much jelly. Got it? Doggone it she did it again!
29/11/90
Why look! You made your bed without even being told to! Thats wonderful Calvin! Gee your Mom sure is nice when you help her. Yeah thats the reason I usually dont. I like Mom to be impressed when I fulfill the least of my obligations.
30/11/90
Look out of the window! Its snowing! Theres must be almost half an inch! By morning Ill bet theres tons of snow! Do you think the schools will close?? What? OH YEAH? WELL SAME TO YOU!! I wonder how a crabby guy like him got to be superintendent.
01/12/90
That was quite a ride. Ill say. Ive never seen a sled catch fire before. Were lucky the pond hadnt frozen.
02/12/90
Why cant I ever find my stupid scarf? Hobbes and I are going outside Mom. This is going to be the biggest snowman ever built! People will come from miles to see our gigantic snoman! This wont go any more. Its too big to push. Ok leave it here. Im exhausted! Well we cant stop now! We need nine more of these! Nine more?! Sure! This is just one of his toes!
03/12/90
Lemonade! Get youre ice-cold lemonade! Just five dollars a glass while it lasts! How are sales? Terrible. I dont understand it. It sure is cold out. Yep. See my lemonade has all-natural refrigeration! Want to buy a glass? Sorry. All my savings are in bonds. Maybe I should start charging TEN dollars so I dont have to sell as much.
04/12/90
When I grow up Im going to be phenomenally rich! Im going to be the richest man alive! But I wont let wealth change me! Rats. That was our last hope. Youre going to be pretty lonely in the nursing home. Maybe then I can finish this book.
05/12/90
Want to hear a joke I made up? Sure! What do you get when you cross a cantaloupe with Lassie? I give up. A mellon-collie baby! Get it?? Ah ha ha ha ha ha! Oh! Oh! Haa ha ha! He just doesnt want to face up to the fact that Ill be the life of every party.
06/12/90
NAB! CLUNK! You just cant ever be too careful. Cheater.
07/12/90
Honey have you seen my glasses? I cant find them anywhere. I havent seen them. ! ! Calvin go do something you hate! Being miserable builds character! OK the voice was a little funny but thats still one darn sarcastic kid were raising.
08/12/90
AUGHH Those child psychology books we bought were such a waste of money.
09/12/90
Aaaaahhh! Eeee! Hee hee hee hee! Woo! Ack! Ive got you! Aaheeeee! Tickle tickle! Ah! Ah! Hee hee hee woo hoo! Im gonna getcha! Im coming after you! Eek! Hee hee. Here I come! Gotcha! Gootchie gootchie! Akpth! Ha ha ha. Eeep! Ha ha hee hee ooh! Ooh! Ha ha ha. Tickle tickle! Whoa! Whoa! Wed better stop. Calm down calm down. Ha ha hoo hoo hee hee ha. Hee hee whoof! Ha ha! (pant pant) hee hee hee wheeeeeeee ... her plan backfired dad. Im all wound up and Mom needs to be put to bed.
10/12/90
Watching a Christmas special? Yep. Another show extolling love and peace interrupted every seven minutes by commercials extolling greed and waste. I hate to think what youre learning from this. Im learning I nee my own TV so I can watch someplace else.
11/12/90
Im writing my Christmas list Hobbes. Should I add anything for you? Hmm... I cant think of anything. NOTHING?! You dont want anything at ALL?!? Ive got a good home and a best friend. What more could a tiger want? It must be sad being a species with so little imagination.
12/12/90
Thanks for helping me mail my letter to Santa. It sure was heavy. Those big envelopes hold only a couple hundred pages. Thats why I used a box. I hope Santa doesnt throw his back out when he gets it. All I can say is THIS year Santa had better bring everything on my list! Ive been extremely good all year! What about the noodle incident? NO ONE CAN PROVE I DID THAT!!
13/12/90
This whole business of Santa rewarding GOOD kids and neglecting BAD kids really bugs me. ... not that I have anything to worry about of course. A paragon of virtue thats you. Right! But see there are certain things a GOOD kid could do that might look BAD in a certain light if one didnt consider all the mitigating circumstances. Like keeping an incontenent toad in your Moms sweater drawer? Exactly. If I was being raised in a better environment I wouldnt do things like that.
14/12/90
I think if Santa is going to judge my behaviour over the last yeaer I ought to be entitled to legal representation. I mean lets face it a lot of Christmas loot is at stake here and the constitution says no person should be deprived of property without due process of law. So you can be my lawyer OK? Its easy! Me?? Sure! Heres a legal bad! Youre all set! OK but I dont take pro bono cases.
15/12/90
OK Hobbes as my lawyer youll need to review the facts of my case. Right. Well try to establish that you were insane at the time of the alleged crimes. Were not copping an INSANITY plea you moron! Were saying Im INNOCENT! Insulting an attorney is a penal offense so watch it buster. Youre supposed to argue that I havent been bad this year and I deserve to be on Santas good list! If THATs our case I advise you to settle out of court. In a minute you and I are going to settle this out of DOORS.
16/12/90
If you ask ME Hobbes the whole notion of instant gratification is a MYTH! I dont ever get what I want when I want it! I always have to wait! Look how long its taken me to be six years old! Practically forever! When do I get to drive?! When can I go see gory violent movies?! Why do I have to wait till Im older? People say lifes a journey but Im tired of wasting my precious time in transit! I say if you want to find out where the road goes get in the fast lane and hit the gas! Spare me the scenery and lets get where were going! Im a busy guy! Ive got places to be! SUMP! SPLOOP Gosh that was over quick.
17/12/90
So long Mom! Hobbes and I are off to the north pole. The north pole? Yep! Were going to see Santa. How come? You already sent him your Christmas list. Yeah but Im afraid Santa might not have considered MY version of certain recent events. Hobbes is going to be my lawyer and present my case. Just how recent are these recent events youre talking about? Gotta go Mom. Its a long walk.
18/12/90
OK heres our strategy: when we get to the north pole we tell Santa that Ive been the victim of malicious slander by my enemies and were appealing to him for justice. We say that Im really a GOOD kid... a good kid with a good heart! We say Im good good good from the moment I get up until... Hey! Theres Susie! ... until the moment a thought enters your head. I dont think she saw us! Quick pack some slushballs!
19/12/90
Susies still concentrating on her snowman! Lets sneak up and barrage her with slushballs! Two minutes ago we were on our way to tell Santa how GOOD you are remember? Have you lost your marbles?! Oops. I forgot. How many presents do you think Id forfeit for just one clean smack upside Susies head?
20/12/90
Look Im not going to be your lawyer if you cant even walk a block without pasting someone with a slushball! Its not just someone! Its SUSIE! Its a GIRL! Santa would understand! He would so! What? Oh yeah? I dont care! Im going to hit Susie with a big icy slushball! Oh really? Well maybe that furry mug of YOURS needs a slushball too! Yeah you heard me! Ow! No biting! Shh! Shh! Hold it! ... did you just hear a snicker?
21/12/90
Plotting to hit me with a slushball eh? Well HERE! POW! See that? See that?! She hit me first! Now if I hit her its justified! Ha ha ha! Sweet revenge! Oh boy! Oh boy! ... or you could PROVE to Santa how good you are. Its your big chance... I DONT WANT TO BE THIS GOOD!
22/12/90
Back from the north pole already? No we didnt even get past Susies house. But Mom I PROVED how good I am! Susie hit me with a snowball and I didnt even get her back! Santa has GOT to give me lots of presents NOW! Why did Susie hit you with a snowball? She overheard us plotting to... I mean um we were just minding our business when suddenly for no reason Susie... OK you lied. Do something good fast and maybe the last hour will sort of even out to neutral.
23/12/90
Eighty million years ago back in the late Cretaceous lived the great tyrannosaur a fearsome and predacious therapod of monstrous size! He weighed six tons or more! He epotomized the concept of the killer carnivore! His jaws had teeth like railroad spikes with fore and aft serrations! This dental hardware was designed for quick eviscerations! With thrashing bites and awful roars the T.Rex would attack! He was its clear a savage mesozoic maniac! Imagin then the panic caused the horror and the mayhem when this monster came to town and ate some folks this A.M.! It was a sight few will forget! He lunged into the crowd! The multitude became unglued! Their screams were long and loud! People pushed to get away! The elderly and small were trampled underfoot by the advancing human wall! Little Tim was on an errand with his brother howard. They dawdled by the candy shop and both boys were devoured. A camera crew from channel three arrived in town to give a live report. At this they failed because they didnt live. At last the menace ate his fill. The big tyrannosaur stomped away to parts unknown where he had lived before. Tyrannosaurs though rarely seen are certainly still around. And no one knows just where or when the next one will be found. Blow your nose dear. Achgth! Tck! Nhggrr!
24/12/90
Well the shopping is done the presents are wrapped and sent and Calvins in bed. For the first time this month theres nothing that has to be done. I know... sometimes this season really seems out of control. We dont often think about what its all supposed to mean. Mm-hmm. Its good to sit by a cozy fire and take some quiet time to reflect. WHATS THIS?! SANTA FLAMBE??
25/12/90
Psst! Wake up! Merry Christmas ol buddy! Merry christmas. I didnt get you a present but youre my best friend in the world Hobbes. Youre my best friend too. I think thats a great gift. Well enough of that! Its almost 4 am! Lets wake up Mom and Dad and see what Santa brought us! Remember we agreed that if Santa gave you any salmon youd share it!
26/12/90
Dear Grandma thank you for the nice box of crayons you sent me for Christmas. This is prompt. Oh yeah I always send grandma a thank-you note right away. ... ever since she sent me that empty box with the sarcastic note saying she was just checking to see if the postal service was still working.
27/12/90
Thats enough TV! Go play outside. I dont WANT to go outside. Hmph.
28/12/90
Behind the impenetrable walls of my snow fort I am utterly invincible! No one dares attack me! Everybody is too chicken! Im outside my fort now!
29/12/90
Its freezing in here! I can almost see my breath! The thermostat is at 68 where its going to stay. Im surprised the water pipes havent frozen! Look my lips are blue! Im catching pneumonia! Im going into hypothermia! If youre cold why dont you go shovel the driveway and get your blood moving? Nice sweater. Hmph.
30/12/90
The whole problem with modern times is that theres no pride in craftsmanship. When most kids make a snowball the just mush a bunch of snow together. Everyones a slave to efficiency! No time for aesthetics! No love of things for their own sake! But when I make a snowball its a work of art! This snow for example is just a little too powdery. It wont sting properly. I prefer a wetter snow: something with some more weight! Something that will really knock the wind out of the opponent! And how much loose rubble and dirt is acceptable before it affects the aerodynamics? Do you get better spin with an ellipsoid or a true sphere? Nobody considers these things any more! Its a lost tradition I tell you! My snowballs arent assembly line productions! They take me longer to make but each one is a unique masterpiece! Thats why I sign them. Watch this - HEY SUSIE! POW POW POW POW. Its a crass culture Hobbes. Shoddy and quick is all anybody knows. Artists always suffer.
31/12/90
By the power invested in me by the mighty and awful snow demons I command you to come to life! LIVE! LIVE! LIVVVE! RRGHH!
01/01/91
*GASP* I (pant pant) MADE it! *GASP* Whats with you? I thought you were out building a snowman. I did (pant pant) but I brought him to life (pant pant) and now hes after me! I barely escaped! Uh huh. Lookout the window! Hes probably lurching around the yard! Good heavens you build a snowman right on the front step?! How are we going to get out the door?! AUGHH! Hes looking in! he knows where I live!!
02/01/91
You brought a snowman to LIFE?? I didnt think hed be evil! What are we going to do? I dunno but weve got to get rid of him somehow. Maybe we could lure him inside and hed melt! It would take him HOURS and if he didnt kill Mom shed have a fit about the water on the floor. Hmm... how did they finally kill Frosty? Beats me. Now I wish Id watched that dumb show! Maybe they stabbed him with an icicle.
03/01/91
Yikes! There he is! Pack snowballs! Maybe we can knock him out! Yaa! Yaaa! UNGHH! The snowballs just STUCK to him! Look its given him an idea! Hes packing more snow onto himself! Hes making himself bigger! Oh NO!
04/01/91
He keeps packing more snow on himself! Hes getting huge! This is really creepy. Now hes made a big snowball and hes putting rocks and sticks in it! I wonder what hes making. Ewww! Hes giving himself two weird heads!! Any time the sun wanted to come out it would be just fine with me. NOW hes added another ARM! Hes turned himself into a deranged mutant killer monster snow goon!!
05/01/91
The snow goon is lumbering off toward the front yard! Lets cut around the house and build a fort! What do you suppose its going to do? I dont know but whatever it is were going to need protection! Calvin that snowman out front is hideous. Why cant you make a NORMAL snowman? I tried Dad. I tried.
06/01/91
You know Hobbes it seems the only time most people go outside is to walk to their cars. We have houses electricity plumbing heat... maybe were so sheltered and comfortable that weve lost touch with the natural world and forgotten our place in it. Maybe weve lost our awe of nature. Thats why I want to ask YOU as a tiger a wild animal close to nature what you think were put on earth to do. Whats our purpose in life? Why are we here? Were here to devour each other alive. Turn on the lights! Turn up the heat!
07/01/91
This will be the strongest snow fort ever built! Ughh ngghh rghh mnhg UNNHH. There! Were safe from that snow goon NOW! I wonder why we havent seen him for a while.
08/01/91
Hi Calvin. Nice snow fort. Ill say! The walls are two feet thick and weve got snowballs in here! Who are you fighting? Theres a snow goon running loose! If I were you I wouldnt stick around. This could get ugly. Whats a snow goon? Its like a snow man but a grotesque evil demented monster. Oh is THAT what all those ugly things you made in the front yard are? What do you mean all those?
09/01/91
Look a NEW snow goon! Thats not the one I made! The original snow goon must be making his OWN snow goons! OH NO! Ill bet hes making an army! In a few days he could build a hundred snow goons! If each of THEM build ANOTHER hundred and then THOSE all build a hundred MORE why... that would be pretty cool if they werent out to kill me. I vote we make tracks for Florida.
10/01/91
Calvin its late! Time to come in! I cant Mom! Ive got to kill snow goons! You can kill them tomorrow after school. Cmon inside. But by tomorrow there will be more of them! Lets go Calvin. Moms and reason are like oil and water.
11/01/91
Can you see the snow goons out there? Yeah. Theyre still making more of each other. How many did you see? About 15. Man how am I going to school tomorrow? Ill never even make it to the bus stop! I cant outrun 15 snow goons! Im as good as dead! Sweet dreams. Yeah right! Can I take an ax to school tomorrow for ... um... show and tell?
12/01/91
The snow goons arent moving! Theyre asleep! Nows our chance to go bump em off! We cant go outside NOW! Its 10 oclock at night! Oh yeah. Mom and Dad are still up. Well have to wait at least an hour.
13/01/91
Calvin this is the last time Im calling you! Get up before you miss the bus! Well look whos finally up! Its Mr Sunshine! You know Calvin from now on youre going to bed earlier. This dragging out of bed late with a surly attitude every morning is going to stop. Youre only kidding yourself bucko. Bedtime is 7:00. We shouldve adopted a 25-year-old with his own apartment.
14/01/91
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! HA HA HA! DIE SNOW GOON DIE!
15/01/91
More water Hobbes! Well freeze the snow goons right where they snooze! Die! Die! Let out more hose! Ha ha! These monsters will be popsicles through July! There! We got em all! Ill spray a little extra water around just to make sure everythings absolutely frozen. Psst Calvin! Your parents light is on! I think your Dads coming! Uh oh! Maybe I should get HIM with the hose too.
16/01/91
That IS Calvin! Hes outside with the garden hose! Its after midnight! What do we have to do CHAIN him in bed?! CALVIN GET IN HERE! WHAT DO YOU THINK YOURE WAAUGHH! THE WHOLE YARDS ICE! Run Hobbes! Dads a snow goon too!
17/01/91
Dad dont kill me! I can explain this! Help! Help! Snow goons! I froze em! They were going to GET me so I had to get them first! Ask Hobbes! Calvin it is after midnight. Believe me we will discuss this VERY thoroughly tomorrow. You get into bed this instant. Like Im going to get any sleep NOW.
18/01/91
See?? See the snow goons? I didnt make them! I mean I made ONE sort of by accident but the rest made themselves! They were building an army see? See thats why I had to freeze them last night! I had to get em while they were sleeping! It was my only chance see? See it all makes sense! See? See?? They never see.
19/01/91
Well Hobbes I guess theres a moral to all this. Whats that? Snow Goons are bad news. That lesson certainly ought to be inapplicable elsewhere in life. I like maxims that dont encourage behavior modification.
20/01/91
What do you know about love Hobbes? Lots! Yeah? Like what? Im not telling. WHY NOT? Its a sophisticated thing. SOPHISTICATED?! Whaddaya MEAN sophisticated?? IM sophisticated! Why wont you talk about it? Nice weather today. RRRRGH!! You know something and you wont tell me what it is! Maybe when youre older. When Im OLDER?! Why cant you tell me now?! Some things you wouldnt understand. Ha! I bet you dont know ANYthing about love! THATs why you wont tell me!! If thats what you want to believe go ahead. TELL ME! NO! TELL ME! NOT! TELL ME! NO! TELL ME! NO! TELL ME! NO! Look just give me a hint OK? One hint cmon! OK here! Snoogy-woogy wips. EWW See? I told you you werent old enough.
21/01/91
You have to admit its slowed down the traffic on our road.
22/01/91
CALVIN!
23/01/91
Any luck? Im so disappointed. HEY JET PILOTS! DO A BARREL ROLL!
24/01/91
WHAP!! Did you thow that?! Who me? Who ME? Who?! ME?? WHO... ME?! Who me???
25/01/91
If we go fast enough and pull up just as we hit those rocks we might if were lucky clear the ravine and have the ride of our lives! On the other hand if we miss well probably spend our few remaining days hooked up to machines and intravenous fluids! Its either spectacular unbelievable success or crushing hopeless defeat! Theres no middle ground! OK there IS a middle ground but its for sissy weasels.
26/01/91
No text
27/01/91
When are we going to get there? Cant you drive any faster?? I dont like to go much faster than this. Can I drive then? Ill bet I could go REAL fast! Hmm... well OK sure. Ill pull over. Dont worry about a thing Dad! Which pedal is the clutch? The left one. Then brake then gas. Here we go! Hang on! Ooh this IS faster! Blow the horn! Make everyone get out of our way! Wheeee! Were airborne! We shouldve done this sooner! Well get there in no time now! I wonder how fast were going. Cant say. We broke the speedometer. This is the only way to travel. Were passing that jet! Way to go Calvin! I LIKE driving! ..SIGHHH.. How much longer NOW? I told you well get there when we get there.
28/01/91
Cmon Calvin! Get up or youll be late for school. Today my SPIRIT is going to school while my body stays in bed. Now my spirit is in bed.
29/01/91
Jump... jump... jump... jump... jump... jump... jump... jump... jump! I win! Youve only won in the outward manifestation of this game. My SPIRIT is still unvanquished. Thats 165 straight games youve lost. My spirit is kicking the spirit of your checkers clear across the room.
30/01/91
Who would like to summarize what we just read? Calvin? How about you? Sorry! Im here against my will. I refuse to cooperate. They can transport my BODY to school but they cant chain my SPIRIT! My spirit roams free! Walls cant confine it! Laws cant restrain it! Authority has no power over it! Calvin if youd put half the energy of your protests into your schoolwork... You can try to leave a message but my spirit screens its calls.
31/01/91
Time for bed Calvin. You can put my body to bed but my spirits going to stay right here so why bother? Why shouldnt I just stay up? Because the body is the home of the spirit and if youre not in bed in two minutes your spirit is going to be permanently nomadic. Home sweet home.
01/02/91
There ought to be a law against having school on days when theres enough snow to play in. Of course I dont think there should be school in FALL either... and summers out altready... and then theres spring... I guess Id go to school a day in November and a day in March. By second grade youd be packing your lunch box with denture cleaners. And before I got to third grade I could reture.
02/02/91
Here comes the giant ship! AHWOOOOOO! AHWOOOOO! But whats this?! Hes going full speed through the dangerous strait! The oil tanker crashed Mom. You poured INK in the bath water??
03/02/91

04/02/91
Look what I made Hobbes. What is it? What IS it? Why its a huge bird foot. Im going to press it in the snow and make everyone think a two-ton chickadee walked by. I guess time weighs more heavily on some peoples hands than others. Hes just jealous because I accomplish so much more than he does.
05/02/91
Hey Dad you know how you wanted me to shovel the driveway? Well I thought up a BETTER idea! Ill shovel and pack the snow into a big ramp! You can get in the car rev up to near red line throw out the clutch leave a patch of multen rubber out the garage and zoom up the ramp! Then we could line barrells and stuff down the driveway and see how many you could clear! Wouldnt that be great?? I dont see why some people even HAVE cars.
06/02/91
AUGHHH! A SNOW SNAKES GOT ME! Horrible inner teeth on its separately moving upper jaw bones are pulling me down its frigid gullet! Run for your life! At least I HAVE a life... unlike some weirdos I know. I suppose if I had two X chromosomes ID feel hostile too.
07/02/91
No one ELSE at office talks about this kind of thing.
08/02/91
I like sledding DOWN hills. But I hate having to climb back up! Its too much work! Its boring! Its slow! I know! Ill sit on the sled and you PULL me up OK? Run as fast as you can and zigzag around trees and stuff! Even my FRIENDS dont do what I want.
09/02/91
Calvins been outside building something since early this morning. I cant tell what it is. Can you? It doesnt look like anything from here.
10/02/91
... so if we subtract five from... OUIR FEARLESS HERO ESCAPES! We join the valiant Spaceman Spiff as he flees his bloatoid captors! Our hero scrambles into his waiting spacecraft! Spiff pressurizes the magnetronic altitude-o-lators and hits the turbo hyper-thrust drive! Instantly our hero blasts to escape velocity! Half a micromoment later Spiff is just another speck in the infinite sea of outer space! Alone and free in an endless frontier! Free to roam the heavens in mans noble quest to investigate the weirdness of the universe! Whee what fun! Im glad you could come home so early! Cmon ol buddy! Lets go exploring and find some gross bugs! Hello? ... speaking... HE WHAT?!
11/02/91
Theres Susie! Heh heh! Watch me knock her fillings loose! YAAA! PIFF You know I THOUGHT Earths gravity felt exceptionally strong today. I guess that explains how you spilled your oatmeal down the heater this morning.
12/02/91
Obviously I cant throw snowballs at Susie when Earths gravity has increased. THIS is a job for... ...for? Mom mustve put my cape in the wrong drawer!
13/02/91
So who is this a job for? STUPENDOUS MAN! Mmf! Ghh! Super heroes wear snow pants? When theres snow out they do! This looks like a REAL job for Stupendous Man! Well of course the zippers going to get stuck if everyone stands around watching me!
14/02/91
Earths excessive gravity is no match for STUPENDOUS MANs stupendous strength! With muscules of magnitude the masked man of might rolls a gigantic snowball... and flies it high into the stratosphere... where he uses his stupendous vision to locate the diabolical arch-fiend ANNOYING GIRL!
15/02/91
From high in the sky STUPENDOUS MAN takes advantage of Earths strong gravity! A direct hit! STUPENDOUS MAN triumphs! With ANNOYING GIRL vanquished the whirlwind wonder zooms back to resume his secret identity! Did you save the day? Justice reigned once more! Calvin Susies Mom just called. I want to talk to you.
16/02/91
Susies Mom says you dropped a snowball the size of a bowling ball on Susie from a tree. It couldnt have been ME! Im very mild mannered. She described exactly the hood and cape I made you. Why it mustve been STUPENDOUS MAN defender of liberty and justice! Im sure Susie deserved whatever she got. Listen to me. You could hurt someone that way and if I ever hear of anything like this again Ill take away your costume for good got it? Hmm this sounds like ANOTHER job for Stupendous Man! Actually it doesnt sound like QUITE his type of job.
17/02/91

18/02/91
Dad how do soldiers killing each other solve the worlds problems? I think grown-ups just ACT like they know what theyre doing.
19/02/91
Hi honey! How was school? I got stuck in my snow pants. Uh oh. What happened? Well the zipper got covered with ice so I tried to force it. Then my mitten got caught and jammed the zipper. I tried to PULL my snow pants off but I forgot to take my boots off first so THOSE got stuck and then the pants got all twisted so I fell over and finally the teacher had to call two custodians to get me out! So I want to be sure to wear them again tomorrow.
20/02/91
Look Ive got some modelling clay! What are you making? This is a hoof. A hoof? Right! This will be a life-size equestrian statue of me! A new horseman of the apocalypse hmm? I think Im going to need more clay.
21/02/91
My essay is entitled After school at my house. ...ahem... Its not that I MIND being chained in the basement its just that when the meat is thrown down the rats have the advantage of numbers and they... What Miss Wormwood? Another parent-teacher conference? I told her to expect you to deny everything.
22/02/91
SSS SNAP FSST POP! SNARRL YOWP GRR FSSSSS PSSSTSS GRR Thats why IM way over HERE.
23/02/91
MOMM! MOM! Whats the matter?? Whats wrong? Hobbes wants a second good night kiss. ITS TWO IN THE MORNING!! He says the first kiss didnt take. Hmph. I dont think THAT one took either. Oh go to sleep.
24/02/91
Susie would you do me a really big favor? No. Pleeeeease?? Its nothing bad. What is it? Just go up to my house open the front door and yell Im home. Why should I? Um... its a surprise. I mean no reason. I just dare you. Well forget it. Cmon theres nothing to it! Look Ill give you a quarter if youll do it! OK. Oh man this is going to be great! Yes! Yes! Im opening the door... Shell never know what hit her! Hee hee hee! IM HOME! Thanks for the quarter sucker. No wait! It didnt happen! Say it again! Doggone it! Whats wrong with that furball?? Wheres his killer instinct when you really ... WAAA KAPOW! Never never never never NEVER trust a tiger. I can always tell when its you by the bad smell! Yoo hoo hoo!
25/02/91
AUGH! Who did this? The Dames scream hit an octave usually reserved for calling dogs but it meant I had a case and the sound of greenbacks slapping across my palm is music to my ears any day. After all Im not an opera critic. Im a private eye.
26/02/91
I keep two magnums in my desk. Ones a gun and I keep it loaded. The others a bottle and it keeps ME loaded. Im Tracer Bullet. Im a professional snoop. Its a tough job but then Im a tough guy. Some people dont like an audience when they work. Enough of them have told me so with blunt instruments that Im a phrenologists dream come true. Snooping pays the bills though. Especially Bill my bookie and Bill my probation officer. So when a tall brunette opened my door with a case for me my heart did a few calisthenics and I took the job.
27/02/91
The dame said she had a case. She sounded like a case herself but I cant choose my clients. She was the pushy type the kind whod break your heart or maybe your arms. I hurried over. Either she had a psychotic decorator or her place had been ransacked by someone in a big hurry. WELL?! How do you explain this? The dame was hysterical. Dames usually are.
28/02/91
What have you got to say for yourself? Dont touch anything. Im looking for clues. The click of a hammer being cocked behind my head focused my thoughts like only a loaded .38 can. The dame had set me up! She didnt want me to solve the case at all! She just wanted a patsy to pin the crime on! Well? I didnt like the way this story was shaping up so I decided to write a new ending with my .45 automatic as co-author.
01/03/91
I introduced the dame to a friend whos very close to my heart. Just a little down and left to be specific. My friend is an eloquent speaker. He made three profound arguments while I excused myself from the room. I always leave when the talk gets philosophical. Youre in REAL trouble NOW young man!!
02/03/91
Id just finished putting the puzzle pieces together when the dames hired goon jumped out of nowhere and practiced for his chiropractic degree. When the discussion was done an all-percussion symphony was playing in my head and the accoustics were incredible. The orchestra went on a ten-city tour of my brain. And I had a season pass with front row seats. I had figured out who trashed the dames living room but since she wasnt my client any more I felt no need to divulge that information. Besides the culprit happened to be a buddy of mine. I closed the case. I guess we shouldve played outside huh?
03/03/91
Isnt it strange that evolution would give us a sense of homor? When you think about it its weird that we have a physiological response to absurdity. We LAUGH at nonsense. We LIKE it. We think its funny. Dont you think its odd that we appreciate absurdity? Why would we develop that way? How does it benefit us? I suppose if we couldnt laugh at things that dont make sense we couldnt react to a lot of life. I cant tell if thats funny or really scary.
04/03/91
Whats up today? Nothing so far. So far? Well you never know. Something COULD happen today. And if anything DOES by golly Im going to be ready for it! I need a suit like that.
05/03/91
I just saw a commercial for a luxury cruise. How come WE dont ever go on vacations like that? Vacations are all just a matter of comparison. Huh? We spend a week in cold uncomfortable tents each year so living HERE the rest of the time seems like a luxury cruise. If your trips are unpleasant your whole LIFE is a vacation. Please tell me Im adopted.
06/03/91
You know I dont think math is a science. I think its a religion. A religion? Yeah. All these equations are like miracles. You take two numbers and when you add them they magically become one NEW number! No one can say how it happens. Either you believe it or you dont. This whole book is full of things that have to be accepted on faith! Its a religion! And in public schools no less. Call a lawyer. As a math atheist I should be excused from this.
07/03/91
An ordinary cheetah can go over 60 miles an hour. A human can hardly do a quarter of that. What a joke? You think cats are so great! Well humans dont HAVE to be so fast or so strong because WERE so much SMARTER! If cats are so great how come they dont have cars or rockets or bombs or nuclear... um... reactors or... or... I mean... And we can see six times better at night than you can! Six TIMES! And boy talk about agility! Hmph.
08/03/91
AUGHH The thrill of the chase is so diminished when ones prey has little legs. OH IM REAL SORRY!
09/03/91
Ha! I landed on chance. I get to take a card! Oh no! It says Defraud the bank. Computer scam diverse assets into your account. Collect $5000. I think Ill buy a few dozen hotels. Ooh you just wait till I land on chance! Monopoly is more fun when you make your own chance cards.
10/03/91
Oh no! Look at poor Calvin! Whats gone wrong? Hes a crude black outline barely containing garish color! What a horrible fate! His eyes dont even point the same direction! Each eye sees a different view! His nostrils are on the front of his nose like a pig! His ears are just flaps on his head! And whats this stuff on top? Is that supposed to be HAIR?! AAUGHH! Calvins hands are balls with sticks in them! He doesnt even have the right number of fingers! Where are his thumbs?? And his feet! They arent the same size! They face out sideways! How can Calvin stand up? Who knows? Look at his moronic expression! His face reveals no spark of intelligence! Calvin is devoid of reality and substance! How can he be saved?? What can be done?? Here we go! Ha ha. RRRRRGGHH! I hate drawing! What a waste of time! Gee it was getting pretty goot at the end.
11/03/91
BOK BOK BOK BOK I kind of resent the manufacturers implicit assumption that this would amuse me.
12/03/91
Hey Dad Hobbes says that tigers are more perfectly evolved than humans! He says that if the playing field was level and we didnt have guns people would be nothing but CAT FOOD! Tell him thats not... There! 10 cents. We bet a quarter you chiseler.
13/03/91
BU-URRPP! CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP CLAP AUTHOR! AUTHOR! ENCORE! Philistines.
14/03/91
Im not going to school today. Oh youre not? Nope! Im staying home and watching television all day! Apparently I was misinformed.
15/03/91
Today for show and tell I brought one of my own patent pending inventions! I have in my hand an invisible cretinizer! One shot renders the victim a babbling simp a dolt an utter moron! OH SURE CALVIN! GIVE US A BREAK! As Ronald proves its quite effective even at long range. HEY!
16/03/91
Find any dinosaur bones yet? Nope. I wish we lived in the badlands of Montana. Its easier there because erosion often exposes the bones. HERE though you just have to start digging and hope for the best. Hence the systematic approach hmm? Right. I guess Ill have to move that sapling.
17/03/91
Uh oh. STOP THIS RIGHT NOW! I had big plans outside today and I dont want to see them ruined. HEY! ARE YOU LISTENING?! Stop raining! I mean it! BOOMM! Oh NO! You want to play rough do you? FINE! Its man against the elements! Conscious being versus insentient nature! My wits against your force! WELL see who triumphs! DO YOUR WORST! CMON. LETS SEE WHAT YOUVE GOT! You cant crush the human spirit! On behalf of all earthly life I defy you!! Ha ha! This is just a little bath! Big deal! I think Ill take off my clothes and splash around! What do you say to THAT?! OW! OW! WHATS WITH THE HAIL?! THATS FIGHTING DIRTY! NO FAIR!! Are you trying to KILL me?! OW! Whats going with you?! Ow! Ow! Im going in! Ow! I quit! I quit! Ill bet theres an explanation for this and Ill bet I dont want to hear it. The universe has an attitude Mom!
18/03/91
Well look at you! Dont you look nice and neat! Yes I believe in the importance of good grooming. Speaking of which Id better get in the tub if I want to be in bed on time. JUST WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?
19/03/91
I heard Calvin splashing in the tub but theres no water on the floor. His towel is hung to dry! The toothpaste cap is on! Theres no mess anywhere! And youre already in bed?? Would you check over my homework tonight so I can correct any mistakes in the morning before school? Thanks Mom.
20/03/91
Good morning Mom. Youre up and dressed? I didnt even call yoU! I like to get up early so the morning isnt rushed. And with the extra time I can review my assignments and be better prepared for class. Im bracing myself for when the other shop drops. Dont get up. Ill fix my own breakfast. Do we have any prunes?
21/03/91
I made my bed and I put my breakfast dishes away! Im off to school now! Have a good day. Thank you. Ill study hard. A good education is invaluable. This is working out great! I cant believe your Mom thinks thats you.
22/03/91
Ive got to say Hobbes Ive really perfected my old duplicator THIS time! Ill grant it needed perfecting. It was so simple to add an ethicator! I dont know why I didnt think of it before! Now instead of making a COMPLETE duplicate of me Ive made a duplicate of just my GOOD side! He does all the work and I get all the credit! Hes a total sap! I know! I know the answer! Youve gotten so many lets let someone else try this one. OK dear?
23/03/91
Last time you made a duplicate of yourself the DUPLICATE made duplicates remember? It was a mess! True but thanks to the ethicator it cant happen THIS time! By only duplicating my GOOD side Ive ensured that THIS duplicate wont cause any trouble! Hes a complete boy scout! Theres nothing this twerp likes better than making everyones life easier! He lives for it! The ethicator mustve done some deep digging to unearth HIM! Talk about someone easy to exploit!
24/03/91
I never get to do anything REALLY fun. If youre bored go clean your room.
25/03/91
When youre done putting my toys away you can get to work on my math assignment. OK. Isnt this the life? We get to do whatever we want while goody-two-shoes here does all the work! He doesnt even complain! Virtue is its own reward. He doesnt complain but his self-righteousness sure gets on my nerves.
26/03/91
Hello may I carry your books for you? Why? So you can throw them in a puddle or something? Forget it! I wouldnt do that! Yeah youd probably do something WORSE! Youre not touching my books Calvin! Strictly speaking Im not Calvin. Im the physical manifestation of Calvins GOOD side. If that was true youd be a lot smaller. Boy have I heard THAT joke a lot. And if you think you can get my books by acting even weirder than usual think again!
27/03/91
Say Calvin that nice girl down the street seems to think youre a total jerk. Who Susie? You werent talking to Susie were you? Yes. I offered to carry her books and she... YOU DID WHAT?! She clearly doesnt trust you at all. Oh man! Nobody SAW you did they?! Theyll think it was ME! You want to make it look like I LIKE her?! She seemed upset so this afternoon I took her some flowers I picked but... AUGHH! AUGHH! AUGHH!
28/03/91
I hear youre pretty smooth with the ladies! Woo woo woo! Oh knock it off! Its that darn duplicate and you know it! Man hes gone too far! I dont mind if he cleans my room and gets good grades but by golly I draw the line at being nice to Susie! Cant that duplicate tell shes a GIRL?! Oh I think hes figured that out. I saw him cutting hearts out of red construction paper! WAUGH! ... And who could make My heart feel woozy? Only thou my fair Sweet Susie.
29/03/91
DONT TELL ME MY DUPLICATE IS WRITING SUSIE MASH NOTES!! You little charmer you! Im the dictator-for-life of the Get Rid Of Slimy girlS club! My reputation! My honor! My principles! Weve got to stop him! Oh no! Hes not in my room! He must be on his way to Susies house! Youre probably going to get smoochies right now! Big wet ones I bet! MORE sarcasm?! You come here again and Ill clobber you Calvin.
30/03/91
You again?! Was I here before? Are you crazy?! You were here just two minutes ago! Uh-oh. Im not STILL here am I? YOURE STANDING RIGHT THERE! WELL ANYONE CAN SEE THAT! AM I HERE ANYWHERE ELSE?! Sheesh. SLAM. Who can fathom the feminine mind? I like em anyway.
31/03/91
Its true Hobbes ignorance IS bliss! Once you know things you start seeing problems everywhere... ...and once you see problems you feel like you ought to try to fix them... ...and fixing problems always seems to require personal change... ...and change means doing things that arent fun! I say phooey to that! But if youre wilfully stupid you dont know any better so you can keep doing whatever you like! The secret to happiness is short-term stupid self-interest! Were heading for that cliff! I dont want to know about it. WAAAUGGHHH! Im not sure I can stand so much bliss. Careful! We dont want to learn anything from this.
01/04/91
THERE you are! There YOU are! Whats the big idea giving Susie a mushy valentine?! Are you nuts? She wouldnt even accept it! YOURE such a jerk she always thinks youre up to something! Who are you calling a jerk you namby-pamby goody-goody! YOU you self-centered conniving brat! Wow how existential can you get?
02/04/91
So its a fight you want is it?! Why Ill tear you limb from... Yeah? Yeah? Oops! I had an evil thought! FFTT. Another casualty of applied metaphysics. My ethicator machine mustve had a built-in moral compromise spectral release phantasmatron! Im a genius!
03/04/91
Youre the only person I know whose GOOD side is prone to badness. Thats why he evaporated. He could only be perfectly good as an abstraction. In his human manifestation he wanted to throttle me. He spectralized just in time! Fascinating. Yes. Of course now you have to do your homework YOURSELF. Actually now that my good side is no longer a physical being I find him that much easier to ignore.
04/04/91
Well thats the end of chapter one. Well stop here. No read the whole book OK? Calvin theres a hundred more pages and its late. Well read another chapter tomorrow. No no! Finish it tonight! Gee you must really like this. I have to write a paper on it tomorrow.
05/04/91
You know what Ive noticed Hobbes? Thinkgs dont bug you if you dont think about them. So from now on I simply wont think about anything I dont like and Ill be happy all the time. Dont you think thats a pretty silly and irresponsible way to live? What a pretty afternoon.
06/04/91
What are you doing out in the rain? Im engaging in a contest of wills! Its me against nature! Its me against nature! Which of us is going to give up first? Is NATURE going to give up and stop raining or am I going to give up and go inside? So far its undecided but Im determined to win! OOOH BIG NOISE! YOU DONT SCARE ME! KEEP IT COMING! IM NOT GOING IN! Poor guy just couldnt stand the suspense.
07/04/91
This meeting of G.R.O.S.S. (Get Rid Of Slimy girlS) will come to order dictator-for-life Calvin presiding! Hail Calvin and Hobbes! On todays agenda well make a list of what girls are GOOD for. Obviously this will be a short meeting! Ha! First tiger Hobbes will record the list for posterity! OK first girls are good for water balloon targets! Ha ha! Second theyre good for NOTHING! Ha ha ha! Hee hee slow down! Number three girls are good for colonizing Pluto! Ah ha ha! What a great list! Number four theyre good for smooching! Hoo hoo! Number five is... WHAT?!? Did you say SMOOCHING?? What kind of treasonous sissy idea is THAT?! Well its true. OOOG! AAACK! I got the dry heaves!! Youre demoted from First Tiger to Tiger Bulk Rate! You cant supress the facts! I award myself a medal of valor! How would you know its a fact?! Have you been a traitor to the cause?! I have my sources! Ow! This unleader-like behaviour will be noted in the club minutes! Have you been smooching the enemy?! Out with it!! YOU have! I saw it so dont try to deny it! ME?! Thats a filthy lie! Youll pay for this vile slander! Oh yeah? Your Mom kissed you right on the cheek last night remember? ...Oh yeah... I guess Mom IS kind of a girl sort of... See? According to club rules you should be excommunicated. OK Presidential pardons all around! Agreed! Well add an amendment saying smooching is optional if its your Mom. This is such a great club!
08/04/91
I have an announcement. As of today I will no longer respond to the name Calvin. From now on I wish to be addressed as Calvin the Bold. Calvin the Bold? Right. Thats my new name for the rest of my life. How about Calvin the deranged? Also Calvin the Bold will being reffering to himself in the third person.
09/04/91
Calvin will you do the next problem please? Calvin? Who?? YOU! CALVIN THE BOLD demands that he be addressed by his full title for any response. Back again hmm Calvin? Who?
10/04/91
Calvin the bold! Yes? Kneel. Huh?? What? Kneel? By the finite patience vested in me I hereby dub thee Mud. You may rise. My name is MUD?! Mr. Subtlety drives home another point.
11/04/91
MOMMM Whats the matter?? How do ugly things like octopuses and hairy bugs reproduce? Are they actually ATTRACTED to each other? ITS 3AM! GO TO SLEEP! Come to think of it I wonder how PEOPLE are attracted to each other. Ill be thats why they close their eyes when they smooch.
12/04/91
Look at what this dumb toaster did to my toast! It didnt cook it enough the FIRST time so I pushed it down AGAIN and now ONE sides BURNED and other OTHERs hardly singed! That toaster ruined my toast! And yet... somehow... life goes on. Beneath that larger perspective is a guy who doesnt want to spring for a new toaster.
13/04/91
You know before there was television kids actually DID things on nice days like this. Times sure change huh Dad? Ever notice how Dad brings up subjects he doesnt want to talk about?
14/04/91
RINNGG
15/04/91
Pull me way back! More... more... more... Hold it!
16/04/91
Lets say life is this square of the sidewalk. Were born at this crack and we die at that crack. Now we find ourselves somewhere inside the square and in the process of walking out of it suddenly we realize our time in here is fleeting. Is our quick experience here pointless? Does anything we say or do in here really matter? Have we done anything important? Have we been happy? Have we made the most of these precious footsteps??
17/04/91
YOUVE BEEN HITTING ROCKS IN THE HOUSE?! WHAT ON EARTH WOULD MAKE YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT?! Poor genetic material? Bad guess.
18/04/91
Want to see a great idea in action? First you drink half of the milk in your thermos. That leaves enough room so you can wad the rest of your lunch in there. See here goes my jelly sandwich and a banana. Let it soak for a minute then shake it all up into sludge and choke it down! Your stomach wont know the difference and it saves your teeth undue wear and tear! Nobody likes my great ideas in action.
19/04/91
Id say Ive had a pretty good life so far. In fact looking back I have only one regret. Whats that? I regret I wasnt born with opposable toes.

Calvin the commercial airline pilot decides not to fly to St. Louis as scheduled! Calvin doesnt WANT to see St. Louis. Calvin wants to see the GRAND CANYON! Tourists on the rim wave to Calvins screaming passengers as the jet roars into the gorge! ... UP CLOSE! What a view! Its an experience none will ever forget! Everyone will be glad later that Calvin took this scenic detour! If I was driving thats where wed go. Well youre NOT driving and Arizona is NOT on the way to the grocery store.
22/04/91
Attention! All rise! This meeting of G.R.O.S.S. is now called to order by the great grandiose dictator-for-life the ruler supreme the fearless the brave the held-high-in-esteem Calvin the Bold! Yes stand up and hail his humbleness now! May his wisdom prevail! Three cheers for First Tiger and El Presidente Hobbes the delight of all cognoscenti! Hes savvy! He has a prodigious IQ and lots of panache as all tigers do! In his fancy chapeau hes a leader with taste! May his orders be heeded and his views embraced! You can tell this is a great club by the way we start our meetings!
23/04/91
This meeting of the Get Rid Of Slimy girlS club is now in session! First Tiger Hobbes will present our financial report. Wait we didnt sing the G.R.O.S.S. anthem. We sing that at the END of the meeting. I want to sing it NOW. We cant. We have to follow proper protocol! See? It says on the agenda that we sing the anthem LAST! Ohhohh GROHOSS BEST CLUB IN THE COSMOS... STOP THAT YOU ANARCHIST!
24/04/91
You get two demerits for singing the club anthem before it was on the agenda! Well YOU get FIVE demerits for not taking off your hat during its hallowed refrain! You cant give me demerits! I outrank you! Ha! Youre just a figurehead! Your duties are ceremonial! I have all the REAL responsibilities! WHAT? Im dictator-for-life! I have ten TIMES the importance of a lowly First Tiger! A HUNDRED times! A MILLION TIMES! If youre so important how come you sing the soprano part of our anthem? THATS JUST TILL MY VOICE CHANGES!
25/04/91
By golly I wont stand for this insubordination! You are hereby demoted to Club Mascot! Oh yeah? Well YOU can be Club Chowder Head because I QUIT! Im forming my OWN club and its going to be a lot better than THIS one! Ha! Your sorry wont have a cool acronym for a name Ill bet! It will too! MY club is called C.A.D. C.A.D? Whats THAT supposed to stand for? Calvins A Dope! THATS NOT A NAME FOR A CLUB!
26/04/91
If youre clubs called Calvins A Dope then Im changing the name of THIS club to Hobbes is a mangy flea-ridden furball! An insult! I declare eternal war on your club! Go ahead! From now on were bitter enemies! Wait till you see my cunning strategies! Ill have maps and secret codes! Ill have strategies! Ill have maps! Ill have codes! Theyll all be better than yours! Im going to write myself a message in code right now! It says Calvin smells like a baboon! Ha! I broke your code already! And I do NOT!
27/04/91
When you see how cool MY club is youll beg to be in it but I wont let you! Who needs your stinky club?! Ive got my own club! My club dedicates itself to the destruction of your club! Good! ITs a battle to the finish! This is total war! Oh yeah? Well see about THAT! What? Only in your dreams fuzzy face! Hey Calvin! Who are you yelling at up there? Yikes! Shh! Its Susie!
28/04/91
Calvin the bug zips across the room in erratic loops... annoying everyone with his incessant whine and dizzying commotion! Worse still he gets into the cookies spreading filth and contamination everywhere! Yes hes a disgusting menace to sanity and health! What a pest! Ha ha ha! What happened? I got swatted.
29/04/91
Hobbes its Susie! Shes right under us! Its the chance of a lifetime! Real smooth pass me the bag of rotten apples weve been saving! Quick! Quick! What about our war? I thought I was out of the club! All charges are dropped! youre back in! Youre back in! Maybe I want a promotion first. ITS YOURS! NAME IT! JUST GIVE ME THE MUSHY APPLES! Mushy apples? Who are you talking to? Susie dont move OK? Stay exactly where you are.
30/04/91
YAA! YAA! GET RID OF SLIMY GIRLS! HA HA! Ooh is she mad at you! Ha ha ha! Our club is a success! I think shes running off to tell on us. Who cares! It was worth it! What a perfect plan! Talk about something well look back on with pride in our declining years!
01/05/91
Susie Derkins says you were throwing mushy apples at her! We were getting rid of slimy girls! Thats our club! Well STOP it! You know better than that! I think youd better come inside. You can tell this is a great club because we always get in trouble for following our charter!
02/05/91
You know everyone says you should stop and smell the roses? Well this morning I did. BIG DEAL! They smelled like a bunch of dumb flowers! It was the most mundane experience Ive ever had! Whos got time for this nonsense! Im a busy guy! Ive got things to do! The LAST think I need is to stand around with my nose in some silly plant! Im glad you found time for this edifying conversation. Yeah well Im going to have to wrap it up. My TV show is about to start.
03/05/91
OOOOOEEE EEBOOEE BOOEEBOO WAHHHOOOO Thats my siren so you know Im coming. Kids dont NEED sirens.
04/05/91
They say the secret of success is being at the right place at the right time. But since you never know when the right TIME is going to be I figure the trick is to find the right PLACE and just hang around! Being with you its just one epiphany after another. And if the right place is in front of the drug store we could read comic books while we wait!
05/05/91
Ive been reading about the beginning of the universe. They call it The Big Bang. Isnt it weird how scientists can imagine all the matter of the universe exploding out of a dot smaller than the head of a pin but they cant come up with a more evocative name for it than The Big Bang? Thats the whole problem with science. Youve got a bunch of empericists trying to describe things of unimaginable wonder. What would you call the creation of the universe? The HORRENDOUS SPACE KABLOOIE! Hmm... that IS better. Almost anything would be. We should lobby to change that. And I think Tyrannosaur should be changed to monstrous killer death lizard.
06/05/91
Oh Mary you look RAVISHING in that skimpy negligee! Mmm... darling dont you wish we were married? But we ARE! ... or did you mean to eath other? Ive got to have you! Lets murder our spouses! MURDER?! You sick animal! I love it when you talk that way. Come here! KISS KISS Sometimes I think I learn more when I stay home from school.
07/05/91
MOM CAN I SET FIRE TO MY BED MATRESS? No Calvin. CAN I RIDE MY TRICYCLE ON THE ROOF? No Calvin. Then can I have a cookie? No Calvin. Shes on to me.
08/05/91
No Mom! Dont put me to bed. I instructed Hobbes to messily devour anyone who brings me in before 9P.M. Your stuffed tiger is in the washing machine. Fine time to take a BATH! Listen just because YOU never take one...
09/05/91
Did you watch the movie on TV last night? Nope. Did you watch the game then? Nope. Did you watch any TV last night? Nope. Then what did you watch?
10/05/91
Insurance?? What a dumb idea! Why would anyone buy insurance from you?!? Thwping!
11/05/91
Hello Dad! It is now three in the morning. Do you know where I am?
12/05/91
Calvin the ant puts down his grain of sand. Hes sick of working all the time! He hates cooperating with all the other ants! Calvin doesnt WANT to labor for the benefit of the colony! Hes an individual with his own needs and desires! From now on Calvin the ant calls his OWN shots! Let some other sap do the queens bidding! If you wont help US around the house why should we work to feed and shelter YOU?! Calvin the flea sucks the blood of his angry host in parasitic contentment!
13/05/91
Calvin are you going to take that stuffed tiger to school again? Sure. Dont the kids make fun of you? Tommy Chesnut did once and now nobody does. Why what happened to Tommy Chesnut? Hobbes ate him! Ugh! He needed a bath too ...
14/05/91
Calvin! Whats all this noise?! Youre supposed to be asleep! Monsters under the bed Dad! I was whacking one with my baseball bat! Goodness Calvin its just your stuffed tiger! You should put away your toys! Sorry ol buddy good thing I missed occasionally huh? Yeah let me see your bat a minute.
15/05/91
Here comes the sports car at 200 miles per hour! Here comes the cement truck! Look out! And here comes an inflammable chemical truck! Oh no!! This ought to be good.
16/05/91
Calvin! What are you doing to our yard?!? Making speed bumps.
17/05/91
I wonder where we go when we die. Pittsburgh? You mean if were good or if were bad?
18/05/91
Were lost again. Ha! Were brave explorers! The word lost isnt even in our vocabulary! How about the word Mommy? Mommmyyy!!
19/05/91
Z PSST! Hey kid wake up! A MONSTER! He heh! Splash splash splash splash splash splash! STOP THAT! I know what youre up to! Whats he doing? Hes trying to make me have to go to the bathroom. Drop drop dop! Fwoosh sploosh fwoosh sploosh! As soon as I get out of the bed hell grab me and suck out my innards with some vile proboscis! Fwishh splish fwishh splish! Thats terrible! Will they stop at nothing?! His plan is working too! Ill never make it till morning! Splash splash splash splash splash! I have to go. But I cant get out of bed! What am I going to do?? The plants on this side of the house sure dont do very well.
20/05/91
It says here that by the age of six ... most children have seen a million murders on television. I find that very disturbing! It means Ive been watching all the wrong channels.
21/05/91
Im not eating this green stuff. Yecchh! Good idea Calvin. Its a plate of toxic waste that will turn you into a mutant if you eat it. Mmmm. Scrape. Urf. Smack. There has got to be a better way to make him eat! Ahhh ... I can feel it working.
22/05/91
Dad how come you live in this house with mom ... instead of an apartment with several scantily clad female roommates? Boy! Ask a simple question and get all your television privileges revoked.
23/05/91
Hobbes have you ever kissed a girl? A few I guess. Really? What was it like? Mmmmmmmm Pop! ... only a lot more so! Gaack! I was hoping it wouldnt be so fuzzy ...
24/05/91
What do you find attractive in women Hobbes? Well Ive always been partial to redheads ... with green eyes. I like green eyes ... and whiskers! Long whiskers! Lets change the subject.
25/05/91
Having transformed myself into a werewolf I search for human sacrifice! Hi Dad! Mm ... hello. Calvin stop that disgusting drooling!
26/05/91
AAAAAAAAA Hm... I dont think so. Oh Cmon. Im right here.
27/05/91
All right class who would like to give his book report first? Calvin how about you? Calvin? Calvin? Spaceman Spiff cooly draws his death ray blaster ...
28/05/91
2 + 7 = I cannot answer this question as it is against my religious principles. Its worth a shot.
29/05/91

FWOOSHH In order to determine if there is any universal moral law beyond human convention I have devised the following test. I will throw this water balloon at Susie Derkins unless I receive some sign within the next 30 seconds that this is wrong. It is in the universes power to stop me. Ill accept any remarkable physical happenstance as the sign that I shouldnt do this. Ready?... GO! Tum te tum doo doo ... Nothings happeniinngg... five seconds to go! TIMES UP! That proves it! Theres no moral law! WHEEE! Ha ha! HEY SUSIE!! SPLOOSH HELP! HELP! HELP! Why does the universe always give you the sign AFTER you do it??

12/06/91
The giant slimy octopus oozes across the beach. His hideous presence terrorizes the sleepy waterfront community. With a sucker-covered tentacle he grabs an unsuspecting tourist. A muffled scream lingers in the salty air! Did you want something Calvin?
13/06/91
Uh-oh. Here comes Moe. The class bully! Okay twinky lets have that ball. Sure Moe. All yours. Never argue with a six-year-old who shaves.

15/06/91
Moe I was wondering something. Are you maladjusted antisocial tendencies the product of your breserk pituitary gland! What? Isnt he great folks? Lets give him a big hand.
16/06/91
Ahh this is the life! Outside in the fresh air all alone... no distractions no irritations... nothing but quiet and serenity... a chance to get a feel for the land... the exhilaration of speed... the opportunity to reflect on things and let the mind wander... *sighhh* Getting out like this really makes the rat race seem ridiculous. The weekends just arent long enough to do whats important. You know I think Ill quit my job and ride my bicycle all the time. OK Dear want me to call the bike shop and see if theyll sponsor your mid-life crisis? Yeah. Ask them if theyll upgrade my shifters too.
17/06/91
A bushel is a unit of weight equal to four pecks. Whats a peck? A quick smooch. You know I dont understand math at all.
18/06/91
Mom can I have some money so Hobbes and I can go to a movie? What movie? The cuisinart murder of central high. I really think there are more constructive ways you could spend your afternoon Calvin. What did she say? Oh she went off on one of her irrelevant tangents again.
19/06/91
Do you believe our destinies are controlled by the stars? No I think we can do whatever we want with our lives. Not to hear Mom and Dad tell it.
20/06/91
Ready? No. Hurry up! Okay Im ready!
21/06/91
I have a question. Do you believe in life after death? You know reincarnation? You just steer okay?
22/06/91
Meed and mild-mannered Calvin ducks into a nearby closet and transforms himself into ... Captain Napalm protector of the American way! Endowed with superhuman powers he quickly ... Mommmmmmm!
23/06/91
The aliens came from a far distant world in a large yellow ship that blinked as it twirled. It rounded the moon and entered our sky. We knew they had come but we didnt know why. Bright the next morning with noisy comotion the ship slowly moved out over the ocean. It lowered a tube and drained the whole sea for transport back home to their galaxy. The tube then sucked up the clouds and the air causing no small amount of earthling despair. With nothing to breathe we started to die. Help us! Please stop! was the public outcry. A hatch opened up and the aliens said Were sorry to learn that you will soon be dead but though you may find this slightly macabre we prefer your extinction to the loss of our job. Thats my science fiction story. Think thats too far-fetched? Not enough really.
24/06/91
Hey Calvin its gonna cost you 50 cents to be my friend today. And what if I dont want to be your friend today? Then the janitor scrapes you off the wall with a spatula. Heck. Whats a little extortion among friends?
25/06/91
I got the new album by Scrambled Debutante. All their songs glorify depraved violence mindless sex and the deliberate abuse of dangerous drugs. Your Moms going to go into conniptions when she sees this lying around. Well I sure didnt buy it for the music ...
26/06/91
Mom will you drive me into town? Why should I drive you Calvin? Its a perfect day outside! What do you think people have feet for? To work the gas pedal.
27/06/91

The fearless Spaceman Spiff flies low over an uncharted planet! Suddenly the alien-indicator light flashes! The bizarrotron shows a 3.7 weirdness level! our hero hits the decelerator! Watching for the alien Spiff reflects that weirdness is natures way of adapting life to its environment. Species are endlessly inventive in their will to survive! ZOUNDS!! THERE IT IS! What horrible circumstances of evolution would conspire to make a creature so profoundly UGLY? Our hero moves in for further examination of its hideousness! WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?? GET AWAY FROM ME!! According to Spiffs field guide the creature is a gurl. Spiff makes a note that the bizarrotron has been reading a bit low lately. WEIRDO!
15/07/91

01/08/91
If you could wish for anything what would it be? A big sunny field to be in. A stupid field?! Youve got that now! Think big! Riches! Power! Pretend you could have anything! Actually its hard to argue with someone who looks so happy.
02/08/91

Tommy told a funny story at school today. I almost died! Tell it to me. Well actually the story itself wasnt so funny ... it was the way he told it. How did he tell it? He was drinking milk and when he laughed it came up his nose!
07/08/91
Youve got two periods to live Twinky. Then its gym class and I turn you into hamburger casserole! I hate gym class. Coach thinks violence is aerobic.

BLECHHH
12/08/91
Calvin the human insect walks across the dinner table. With proportional insect strength. He places a giant pea on the edge of a spoon. He then climbs to the top of the other end ... and with a tiny jump ... Calvin stop that!
13/08/91
In his minuscule size it takes Calvin the human insect ten minutes to walk across a books page! At the other end he slowly lifts the gigantic sheet! Then its another ten-minute journey back as he turns it over! Gee the kids been quiet for almost twenty minutes. Hes doing his homework.
14/08/91
Heres a movie we should watch. Whos in it? It says Japanese cast. Two big rubbery monsters slug it out over a major metropolitan centers in a battle for world supremacy. Doesnt that sound great? And people say that foreign film is inaccessible.
15/08/91
Oh Rosalyn youre here! Good. Come in! We really appreciate your coming on such short notice. Weve had a terrible time getting a baby sitter for tonight. Ha ha. Maybe little Calvin here has gotten himself a reputation. Ha ha. You have the half up front? Yes let me get my purse ...

17/08/91
Thanks again for baby sitting Rosalyn. Calvin was no trouble at all. Thats good. Ill get the car and drive you home. There you go. Good night. Thank you. Good night. Is she gone?
18/08/91
I dont like the real experience. Its too weird to figure out! You never know whats going on! You dont have any control over events! I prefer to have life filtered through television. That way you know events have been packaged for your convenience! I like a narrative imposed on life so everything logically proceeds to a tidy conclusion. And if you dont like whats happening click you change the channel and theres something different! Thats how real life should be. Click. Oh good a farce!
19/08/91
Susie wanna hear a secret? Sure. I think the principal is a space alien spy. Hes trying to corrupt our young innocent minds so well be unable to resist when his people invade the Earth! Promise not to tell anyone? Dont worry.
20/08/91
Hobbes what should I do when Moe comes to beat me up in gym class? Well you can always do what we tigers do when a rhino charges. Whats that? We scramble like maniacs for the nearest tree. Thats your advice?!? To sit in a tree all day? It doesnt impress the girls of course but theres no sense in impressing them and then getting killed my dad used to say.
21/08/91
Hobbes I need your help. that bully Moe. Keeps pushing me around. So I want you to come to school and eat him ok? Eat him? Sure! Tigers eat people allthe time! What if the cafeteria ladies wont let me use the oven?
22/08/91
Its too early to be in bed. Its hardly even dark out. Why do I have to be in bed? Its ridiculous. Im not even tired! I dont need to be in bed! This is an outrage! Its the stupidest thing I can imagine! I think Mom and Dad are just trying to get rid of me. I cant sleep at all. Can you sleep Hobbes? No!
23/08/91
Ok Mom. Hobbes and I have formed a lobby. We want more privileges. more privileges? Like what? Youve got it made! No responsibilities no cares no worries! What more could you possibly want? Why didnt you tell her about the credit cards in our names? You heard her. Shes in one of her moods.
24/08/91

07/09/91
Arr! Look alive. Ye scurvy scalliwags! Thars a frigat to board! Run up the skull and crossbones! Prepare the plank! Our ship is a plank. And youre going to walk it wise guy!
08/09/91
We think EVERY sport should be played cross-country.
09/09/91
A bee landed on your back! A bee?! Acckk! Get it away!! Dont move and it wont sting you. Just stand still and try not to imagine that it might very well crawl down your shirt and into your pants! He imagined it.
10/09/91
Ok lets flush it! Flush. Ha ha ha. Hee hee! That was great! Lets do it again! Flush. I dont want to know what hes doing do you. No lets go check.
11/09/91
Ive had trouble choosing a new hobby. First I wanted to collect bugs. Then I wanted to collect stamps. What did you decide on? Stamped bugs.
12/09/91
Everbody I know has either cable TV or a VCR! They can watch anything they want! But me? I have to watch dumb ol summer repeats! I have to watch the same garbage over and over! How cruelly we mistreat you Calvin. ... so then he gave me Oliver Twist to read and said I might identify with it. Rats ... and Sorority Row Horror is on cable tonight.
13/09/91
I got a helium balloon. Very nice. Im going to stand on this ladder and let the balloon carry me up and away. Nothings happening. Try jumping. See? There goes the balloon and you didnt hang on.

15/09/91
Wow! Calvin suddenly finds himself on his own sheet of notebook paper! Fortunately Calvin has been doodling all morning. Heres a tank! Pleased by how well its rendered Calvin climbs in! The blue ruled guide lines are no match for the tanks heavy treads! Calvin roars across the page anywhere he wants! Theres the school! Calvin fires directly into Miss Wormwoods classroom! Kids dive out of the windows! Oh no! Miss Wormwood has come to put a stop to Calvins fun! He fires again and again but shes too big and mean! Hand it over Leonardo and see me after class. The arts are always the first to go in public schools.
16/09/91
Cmon Calvin! I signed you up for swimming lessons. I dont want swimming lessons!! Too late. Lets go. What about Hobbes? Did you sign him up too? No its not good to get tigers wet. Why is that? It takes us all day to dry and until we do we smell funny.
17/09/91
I cant believe my mom signed me up for swimming lessons. Here I am freezing my buns off at 9 in the morning about to jump into ice water and drown. The only thing that could possibly make this worse would be if the class was ... taught by my sadistic baby sitter!! Well look whos here!
18/09/91
Ok ... everyone in the water! I refuse! Im freezing already! Calvin do you know what a Rat Tail is? No. its when you soak a towel and twist it up into a whip. It stings like crazy and is much worse than being cold. Get my drift? I always though lifeguards were just taught how to resuscitate people and things like that.
19/09/91
This water is freezing! Im going to go into shock and drown I just know it. I bet the lifeguard is involved in some insurance scam and shes going to let us all drown like rats! Oh no! oh no! ok first were going to learn the deadmans float. Mom!! Helpp! Helpp! What I put up with to pay for college.
20/09/91
I dont want to learn how to swim! I dont need to know how. Ill just stay on dry land all my life. What if you fall out of a boat? No big deal.
21/09/91
Forty minutes of terror! Why did you sign me up for this? Why not something fun. Like hang gliding or sharpshooting? Or driving lessons! I could be taking driving lessons and learning something useful! How about piano lessons? You start Tuesday? Ack! No no no no no no no no no.
22/09/91
WATCHOO
23/09/91
Hi Calvin what are you doing? Big important secret things! Go away! Get lost! All right dandelion head! Who cares what you do anyway! Were doing great things. Were having fun! I thought we were bored out of our skulls. Oh hush. You dont know anything.
24/09/91
That stupid Calvin. Hes so mean. All I try to do is be friends and he treats me like Im nobody. Well who needs jerks like him anyway? I dont need him for a friend. I can have fun by myself! Poop!
25/09/91
Susie Hobbes thought I was rude so Im sorry and you can come play with us if you want. Thanks Calvin. Thats really nice of you. Ok well play house now. Ill be the high-powered executive wife the tiger here can be my unemployed housekeeping husband and you can be our bratty and brainless kid in a day care center. This was your idea pea brain. Dont you talk to your father that way! Im off to wall street. Dont wait up.
26/09/91
The aliens are gaining on our hero! In a surprise move Spaceman Spiff shifts into reverse! The aliens roar ahead! Spiff shifts back into forward and pursues the aliens! ... but the aliens have turned around and are headed straight for our hero! Spiff shifts into reverse! Im getting sick.
27/09/91
Whack! Tell me this isnt a spitball!!
28/09/91
Hobbes quick! How do I stop?!? Steer into a gravel driveway and fall down! Skrunch! That was only a suggestion.
29/09/91
IM HO-OME! Ever notice how time slows down during a catastrophe? Sighhh... and good times are always over so fast.
30/09/91
Look at that thing in the dirt! It must be a fossil! I wonder what peculiar animal this was. But its not a bone. It must be some primitive hunting weapon or eating utensil for cave men. Maybe it had some religious function. This explains why your clothes stay on the floor.
01/10/91
Making a sign? Im declaring the creek back in the woods Calvins creek. When you discover something youre allowed to name it and put up a sign. But suppose you didnt discover that creek. Of course I did! Nobody else has a sign there right?
02/10/91
Can Hobbes and I go play in the rain Mom? No. why not? Youll get soaked. Whats wrong with that? You could catch pneumonia run up a terrible hospital bill linger a few months and die. I always forget. If you ask a mom you get a worse-case scenario. I had no idea these little showers were so dangerous.
03/10/91
Want to go spelunking with me? Spelunking? There arent any caves around here! You dont need a cave. All you need is a rock. Spelunk!
04/10/91
Well dad off to work? Too bad Im on summer vacation so I get to stay home and do whatever I want. Well go off and join the rat race! Mom and I are racking up lots of expenses! Oog. I just do that to help him appreciate the weekends more.

Hot day isnt it? Ill say. But its the humidity that really gets to me. You dont like it when its humid? Not at all. Then youd better get out quick.
06/10/91
Recess! A school day break for play and exercise. Little does Susie realize how much exercise she is about to get! She turns at the sound of running feet behind her... have her friends come to join her? NO! Its a pack of ferocious deinonychus dinosaurs!! Screaming Susie hurls herself towards the school doors but the pack is closing in! With the grim efficiency of wild dogs th epredators have a meal! Across the playground students huddle in stupefied horror! Which one of THEM will be next? Thus the weak and stupid are weeded out in a heartless but essential natural selection keeping the human population in check. ... At least thats how it OUGHT to be. Thank you for that tasteless and entirely uninformative report on overpopulation. See me after class. Ya like that Susie?
07/10/91
Whats for dinner? Salmon. Salmon?! Blecchh!! Calvin one of these days your face is going to freeze like that. Wow!
08/10/91
Hi Hobbes! Good heavens whats wrong with you? Mom said if I keep making this face it will freeze like this forever! You really think so? Its worth a try ... Ill bet my features are hardening already. I always liked gargoyles.
09/10/91
Dont make faces at the table Calvin. I cant help it. Mom said my face would freeze like this some day and it just did. No it didnt. it did dad! Mom was right Im horribly disfigured for life. No you arent. but dont worry I wont spoil dinner. See? Elephant man!
10/10/91
Here comes Susie. Ha! Wont she be horrified to see how our faces have tragically frozen! Hi Susie. Hi Calvin. What did you do get your head stuck in a blender? Its an improvement.
11/10/91
Are the coals hot? Yes theyre very hot Im just about to put on the hamburgers. Before you do could you toss in the can of lighter fluid and make a giant fireball? Ive got the most boring dad in the world.
12/10/91
With these snorkels we can stay under the water indefinitely. Just think of all the fish well be able to see! We can collect shells! Lets go! Well so far this has been a major disappointment.

Add two eggs and stir. Right. The recipe says it makes twenty pancakes so well each get ten. Nah thats too much trouble. Well just make one big pancake and cut it in half.
15/10/91
Dad I want a bedime story! Im busy Calvin Ill read you one tomorrow. If you dont read me a story I wont go to bed! Once upon a time there was a boy named Calvin who always wanted things his way. One day his dad got sick of it and locked him in the basement for the rest of his life. Everyone else lived happily ever after. The end. I dont like these stories with morals.
16/10/91
Dinners ready Calvin. Come to the table. Im watching television. No youre not! Yes I am. Im right here in front of it! No youre not! Oh thats right. Im at the table.
17/10/91
I saw a turtle down by the creek. Big deal! Who cares? Ive seen hundreds of turtles! Probably millions! Who wants to see another dumb ol turtle? Ha!
18/10/91
Can I ride in a grocery cart? I think youre a little big for that now. Please?? All right. Up you go. Oh boy! Now run down the aisle and let go!
19/10/91
Aawweeawweeaaw! The water looked a little cold eh Tarzan?
20/10/91
The fearless Spaceman Spiff pilots his craft at speeds never before imagined! He discovers galaxies and planets never before charted! He courageously lands on alien worlds never before explored... ...bravely confronting space species never before encountered! Yes our hero the incredible Spaceman Spiff is a cosmic pioneer boldly facing the unknown in a universe of wild adventure! EWW! Ive never had this before! I wont eat it!
21/10/91
I think Im using too strong a sun screen.
22/10/91
Fishing is the most boring sport in the world. Weve been sitting here for twenty minutes and not one thing has happened! Waaughh!
23/10/91
Youre on my half of the bed! Move over! Your side is way over there! Give me back those covers! Calvin be quiet and go to sleep!! You heard Dad. He said to get on your side and leave the covers alone. Thats not what he said! Hey! You stole my pillow! This lumpy one is yours!
24/10/91
With a drink of magic elixir Calvin turns himself invisible. Completely transparent he roams undetected! Calvin? Boy as soon as you want something done around here that kids nowhere to be seen.
25/10/91
Ha ha! I have turned myself invisible! By removing my clothing I can perpetrate any crime undetected! I have complete freedom! I can get away with anything! Calvin! What on earth are you doing in the cookie jar without your clothes on?!?
26/10/91
Your polls are slipping Dad. Better get with it. Calvin being your Dad is not an elected position. I dont have to respond to pools. Not elected? You mean you can govern with dictatorial impunity? Exactly. In short open revolt and exile is the only hope for change? I dont like the direction this conversation is taking.
27/10/91
This is my latest snow sculpture. Where? All of this! But you didnt do anything. Right. Art is dead! Theres nothing left to say. Style is exhausted and content is pointless. Art has no purpose. All thats left is commodity marketing. Consequently Im signing this landscape and you can own it for a million dollars. Sorry... it doesnt match my furniture. The problem with being avant-garde is knowing whos putting on who.
28/10/91
Hey Mom. Can we go out for pizza tonight? No we had pizza last night and besides its too expensive to eat out all the time. Oh youd rather blow the evening cooking and washing dishes than spend a few bucks? It seems like we go out for pizza a lot these days. If youd rather fix a dish of cereal at home be my guest. Hobbes wants triple anchovies.
29/10/91
Calvin and his trusty navigator Hobbes roar down the residential road at 90 MPH! Hobbes puts on the turn signal. Faster and faster they go! A busload of school children dives from the sidewalk! Hobbes puts on the windshield wipers. The police are after them! Calvin crawls down to put in the clutch and shift! Hobbes steers and blows the horn! All right Im back already! Cant I even run an errand without you blowing the horn across the parking lot?! It was Hobbes Mom not me.
30/10/91
See any UFOs? Not yet. Well keep your eyes peeled. Theyre bound to land here sooner or later. What will we do when they come? See if we can smell Mom and Dad into slavery for a star cruiser.
31/10/91
Z. Yawn! Ta daa! Sheesh.
01/11/91
Calvin I dont want you up in that ree. Why not? Some of the branches are dead and they might break. Come on down. Mom spoils everything. This isnt quite the same is it?
02/11/91
Gloonk! Gloonk! Calvin drink your milk in little sips!
03/11/91
Some November this is. The leaves are down but theres now snow. Everything is just sitting around waiting for winter but nothing is happening. Cmon whats the big holdup?! Lets go up there! Bring on the snow! Sighh No efficiency. No accountability. I tell you Hobbes its a lousy way to run a universe. Whatever happend to the work ethic?
04/11/91
Pay up squirt. Forget it Moe. Im not giving you the money. In fact I dont even have any. Gee thats too bad. Oh wait yes I do! Here. For a kid with a monosyllabic vocabulary hes awfully persuasive.
05/11/91
Ok Hobbes heres the plan to put Moe out of commission. You come to school with me and when Moe comes to steal my money you jump out and eat him! Eat him?? I couldnt do that! Sure you could! Whats wrong with that?! Fat kids are high in cholesterol. Well just chew him up and spit him out I dont care!!
06/11/91
If that bully is extorting money Im going to call the school and put an end to it. Dont do that! If Moe finds out I squealed Im a goner! This kid cant get away with stealing Calvin. Somebodys got to do something. Heres a list of what Im wearing. See you at the morgue.
07/11/91
Hey Twinkie heres the 2 cents I borrowed from you the other day. Somebody ratted on me and its gonna be a dark day if I ever find out who! I think Ill use the quarter to call my insurance agent.
08/11/91
Hi Dad its me! Calvin is this important? Im very busy this morning. Ill make it fast Dad. Can you pick up some topsoil and grass seed on your way home? Ok. Sure. Goodbye.
09/11/91
Ring Ring. Hello Calvin speaking. Id like to order a large anchovy pizza. What? I ... ?? oh Im sorry. You must have dialed the wrong number. Goodbye. I try to make everyones day a little more surreal.
10/11/91
... sighhhh... Weve been out here half an hour and nobodys attacked our fort. We dont have enough enemies thats our problem. Were just too darn popular. Yeah everybody likes us because were so great. Its true. And of course Im a genius so people are naturally drawn to my fiery intellect. Their admiration overwhelms their envy. Actually I believe jungle cats are held in higher esteem whereas one can hardly take a kid out in public. Tigers add panache and savoir faire to any social occassion. Whaddaya MEAN kids cant go out in public?!? At least kids dont have FLEAS! Thats only because fleas cant stand the way kids SMELL! By golly youre asking for a snowball in the mouth! You cant threaten me! Ive got snowballs too! PIFF PAFF PEFF POOF PUFF You know maybe we dont NEED enemies. Yeah best friends are all I can take.
11/11/91
What are you doing? Being cool. You look more like youre being bored. The world bores you when youre cool.
12/11/91
Look I brought a sombrero! Now we can both be cool. A sombrero? Are you crazy?! Cool people dont wear sombreros! Nobody wears sombreros! What fun is it being cool if you cant wear a sombrero?
13/11/91
Im back. See. I put on some Mickey Mouse pants! Ill be cool in these boy. Just look at these big yellow buttons! Mickey Mouse pants?!? You dont look cool! You look like an idiot! Hmph! Maybe Im new wave. Maybe youre just stupid.
14/11/91
Here comes Susie. Im going to throw a pine cone at her. Wwhippp. Pow!
15/11/91
Yahh! Oof! Grrr! Rgh! Rr! Rrr! Uh! Uh! Rrr! Umph! Touchdown! Lets play something else.
16/11/91
Are there any monsters under my bed tonight? No. Nope. No. If there were any monsters under my bed how big would they be? Very small. Go to sleep. Momm!

With great effort Calvin the human insect advances the paper in the typewriter. His only hope for proper medical treatment lies in his ability to write a legible message to his family! He craws to each key and jumps! Who wrote Help Im a bug on my letter to Grandma? Evidently some bug. How strange.
19/11/91
Back and forth. Back and forth. Tidal wave! Beats me Mom. Maybe the seal around the tub leaks.
20/11/91
Whats this music? Its The 1812 Overture. I kinda like it. Interesting percussion section. Those are the cannons. And they perform in crowded concert halls?? Gee. I thought classical music was boring!
21/11/91
Boy what a day! I went to school. Played outside and did my homework. Im exhausted. You know what time it is now? Uh 7:35. Its Miller time. Get back here.
22/11/91
Psst ... Susie! Whats 12 + 7? A billion. Thanks! Wait a minute. That cant be right ... thats what she said 3+4 was.
23/11/91
I just read this great science fiction story. Its about how machines take control of humans and turn them into zombie slaves! So instead of us controlling machines they control us? Pretty scary idea. Ill say hey! What time is it?? My TV show is on!
24/11/91
Mm this dinner you fixed is delicious honey. What is it? Its dog food. And dont call me honey. You cant feed me DOG food! Im the President of the United States! No youre the President of the Deluded Fruitcakes Anonymous! Give me a break! Youre just mad because youre the First Husband and you have to vacuum the White House all day! I DO NOT! In fact Im not your husband at all! What are you doing?! Stop being such a little weirdo! Me WONGA-TAA king of the jungle! Oh nice underpants! Youre really gross. Me off to jungle! Find tiger friend! Live with animals! I can run the country better without you! Good riddance you moron! It take one to know one! Boy am I glad to see YOU. Playing with Susie is a big waste of time. You wouldnt believe the junk she can imagine. Nice underpants. What do you mean Calvin left his clothes with Susie??
25/11/91
Tomorrow were going to discuss current events in school. Each of us has to find a newspaper article read it to the class and explain it. What article did you choose? This one. Space alien weds two-headed Elvis clone. Actually theres not much left to explain.
26/11/91
Look what you can do with big socks! Just put one over each ear and one over your nose. An elephant! Ha ha! I want some socks too! If I miss the bus. Its going to be unpleasant around here!
27/11/91
Calvin how did you break this dish! I was carrying too much and it dropped. Your problem is youve got no common sense. Ive got plenty of common sense! I just choose to ignore it.
28/11/91
I dont understand this business about death. If were just going to die. Whats the point of living? Well theres seafood. I dont know why I even talk to you before dinner.
29/11/91
Ive decided I want to be a millionaire when I grow up. Well youll have to work pretty hard to get a million dollars. No I wont you will. Me? I just wan to inherit it.
30/11/91
The worst part about going to school is waiting for the bus. All you can do is stand here and imagine whats going to go wrong during the day. I bet we have a pop math quiz or something. Well here comes the bus. Thanks for waiting with me. My pleasure. Boy my lunch box seems light.
01/12/91
What an awful job! This is the worst! Well somebodys got to do it. HEADS UP! BLORRP! Eeww! Whats THIS?! Ugh who can tell? KEEP STIRRING!! Oh no! Its bubbling up! AIEE! Chemical reaction!! LOOK OUT! RUN! RUN! ITS GONNA BLOW! FOOM! BU-URRRPP!
02/12/91
As you can see Spaceman Spiff we have ways of extracting information from even the most uncooperative prisoners! Our hero captured by Zorkons eyes the diabolical instruments of torture! Very amusing. You twisted space frog. Whats this fiendish device called? A chin-up bar. Get on it. Spiff readies his daring escape.
03/12/91
Wheres my jacket? Its right on the floor where you left it. Its still on the floor? Why didnt you put it away? Gee my own copy of the emancipation proclamation.
04/12/91
Look I can make shadows on the wall heres a dog. Hey thats good! Heres a swan. Hmm ... that looks more like some bug eyed tentacled thing. Mommm!
05/12/91
Ah ... Ah ... Ah ... Ah ...kbthchh! Whyd you hold it in? Im trying to blow my shoes off.
06/12/91
It says on the back of this record that the composer could play the piano at age three. He wrote his first symphony when he was four. Thats amazing. When I was four I think I was toilet trained.

Moms not feeling well. So Im making here a Get Well card. Thats thoughtful of you. See on the front it says Get Well Soon. And on the inside it says Because my bed isnt made my clothes need to be put away and Im hungry. Love Calvin. Want to sign it? Sure. Im hungry too.
10/12/91
Hi Mom! Since youre sick. Im bringing you breakfast in bed! I prepared eggs toast and orange juice for you all by myself! How nice! The eggs kind of burned and stuck to the pan but you can probably chip them out with this chisel. Um ... where is the toast and orange juice? Dad said not to tell you about that till your better.
11/12/91
Since your Moms sick. Ill be making dinner tonight. You can cook? As you can see I survived two years of my own cooking when I had an apartment after college. Mom says you ate frozen waffles and canned soup three meals a day. Your Mom wasnt there so she wouldnt know. Get the syrup out will you?
12/12/91
Sometimes when Im sick you read me a story want me to read you one? No thanks Calvin. I just want to rest. Its hard to be a Mom for a Mom. You do fine sweetie. Whoa! Hey! Are you contagious?!
13/12/91
Whats wrong with your Mom do you know? No she went to the doctor today though. I wonder if ... nah. What? You dont suppose shes going to have a baby do you? A baby?!? Why would she want another kid?? Shes already got me! Yes. Youd think shed have learned her lesson ...
14/12/91
I asked dad if mom was going to have a baby and he said not that he knew of. Dad said wed know if mom was having a kid because shed look like a hippopotamus with a gland problem. ... thats when Mom creamed him with her pillow. Dad says she must be feeling better. You have weird parents.
15/12/91
KAZAM! KAZAM! Quiet. What did I just tell you?! Calvin if youre bored Ill find something for you to do! KAZAM!
16/12/91
Want to trade sandwiches Calvin? No Ive got my favorite kind. What did you bring? Peanut butter. I have processed mouse loaf. Oh gross. Thats not really mouse loaf. It looks like egg salad. Taste it and see. Here. I think this is a whisker its good. Forget it. I dont even want my own lunch anymore. You dont? what kind of cookies are those?
17/12/91
Ta-daaa!!
18/12/91
How do they know the load limit on bridges Dad? They drive bigger and bigger trucks over the bridge until it breaks. Then they weigh the last truck and rebuild the bridge. Oh. I shouldve guessed. Dear if you dont know the answer. Just tell him!
19/12/91
Its hard to believe people still starve in this world. Theres even hunger in America. Some people never get enough to eat. Boy I know what thats like! No you dont.
20/12/91
The soldiers advance up the hill! Oh no! a squadron of bombers appears on the horizon! The bombs begin to fall! Bonk bonk. Two direct hits! I see you up there!
21/12/91
Look Hobbes you get a plastic trinket in boxes of Chocolate-Frosted Sugar Bombs! It says Be the first in your neighborhood to collect all ten colors. Yeah but Mom says she wont buy any more cereal until this box is gone. That shouldnt take more than a couple of hours right? I dunno after five bowls I get pretty wired.
22/12/91
I wish Santa would publish the guidelines he uses for determining a kids goodness. For example how much does he weigh motives? Does he consider the kids natural predisposition? I mean if some sickeningly wholesome nerd LIKES being good its EASY for him to meet the standards! Theres no challenge! Heck anyone can be good if he WANTS to be! The true test of ones mettle is being good when one has an innate inclination towards evil. I think one good act by ME even if its just to get presents should count as FIVE good acts by some sweet-tempered kid motivated by the pureness of his heart dont you? HEY SUSIE! POW! Of course in your case the question is academic. I wanted to put a rock in the snowball but I didnt! That should be worth a lot!
23/12/91
Calvin your dad and I are going out tomorrow. So youll be having a baby sitter. Oh no! not Rosalyn! I called eight people and shes the only one who would do it. Call some more! Call some more! Calvin I spent half an hour on the phone already. Rosalyns fine. Fine?? shes a barracuda in a high school senior suit! Im as good as dead! You remember Amy? She just laughed when I called her.
24/12/91
Oh no! A knock at the door! The baby sitter must be here! Should we hide? No way. Baby sitters can smell fear in little kids. Wed be doomed. So we go on the offensive? Right. Heres a notepad and pencil. Oh boy blackmail! Right get to the upstairs phone when she calls her boyfriend.
25/12/91
Were going Rosalyn. Help yourself to anything in the fridge. Ok good-bye. Calvin? Are you upstairs? Wap wap. All right kid! Bedtime for Bonzo!! What?! Get away! Its not even 6 oclock!
26/12/91
I cant believe our baby sitter put us to bed! Its not even dark out! Well she can put us to bed but she cant make us sleep. You play the horn and Ill accompany on tom-tom. Calvin I just wanted to remind you that sleeping in a bed is a privilege. The basement is sure to be a lot less comfy. What did she mean the basement? Shhh!
27/12/91
Rosalyn were going to be a little later than we expected so I thought Id better call you. Thats fine. Calvin went to bed early so Im just holding down the fort. Whos on the phone? Is it my Mom? I want to talk to her! Mom! Mom! Can you hear me?! Come home now before its too late! Help! Help! No thats just the tv. Ill see you at 11:30 then. Enjoy the play.
28/12/91
Sorry were late Rosalyn. Did you get Calvin to bed? Yes but ... Mom! Dad! Is that you? Im not asleep! Did you get rid of the baby sitter? Thank goodness youre home! Has he been this way all night? Well his voice gave out about 11 oclock but it seems to be If shes still here dont pay her! Give her a little extra will you dear? Is five enough? Could you make it eight? College tuitions are up.
29/12/91
Everybody makes the wrong kind of New Years resolution. All they do is promise to stop bad habits and start good habits. Whats wrong with that? Its not enough to change a few little habits! Everybody I know needs a complete personality overhaul! Thats why Ill be spending the remaining days of this year telling people what I hate about them and how they should change. Some of us would be happy to reciprocate. Sorry. MY New Years resolution is not to change a bit.
30/12/91
What a rotten day. Zz ... mmp ... bgz ... ahhhhh ... gnz ... hee hee ... zzz ... Fuzz therapy. Zzz ... nuk nuk ... woonk ...
31/12/91
Hello Susie. This is Calvin. I lost our homework assignment can you tell me what we were supposed to read for tomorrow? Are you sure youre not calling for some other reason? Why else would I call you? Maybe you missed the melodious sound of my voice. What are you crazy?? All I want is the stupid assignment. First say you missed the melodious sound of my voice. This is blackmail!
01/01/92
Im home from school! Oof! Helloooo. Bonk bing boing. Hows that for an enthusiastic greeting?? Sometimes I wish youd just buy me one of those I missed you cards.
02/01/92
Ive got a great idea for school tomorrow. I cut a ping-pong ball in half and now Im drawing dots on each end. Ill just put one over each eye and it will look like Im really paying attention. Or will I look too interested? I doubt it. Im over here.
03/01/92
Bad news on your polls Dad. You slipped another two notches. Things are looking grim for future office. Is that so? Any ideas on what would improve my standings? I need a VCR. Right Ill keep that in mind. I hope youre reading the Help Wanted Section.
04/01/92
Look I got a letter Im supposed to copy and send to 20 people for good luck. Its a chain letter. It says A man in Denver made 20 copies and the next day he got a raise. A man in Seattle broke the chain and he went bald. Ha! You believe that? These letters are for superstitious nincompoops. Throw it away. ... and a dumb kid like you listened to a friend and got run over by a cement mixer.
05/01/92
Its a new year... a new beginning! New possibilities! This snowman represents the spirit of the new year. Looking ahead he strides forward with confidence and determination! He challenges! He imagines! He invents! He calls forth the best qualities of the human drive and ingenuity! Very inspiring. Thanks you. ... and over here is the REAL world? Right. This is why were always glad when the old year is over.
06/01/92
I spelled Be how many points do I get? Um ... 2 points. 2 points?! Is that @*#%! all?? My this game does teach new words! See I spelled zygomorphic on a triple word score box. Thats 150 points. All Ive got is consonants. Your turn. Well if I use your letter I I can spell in. Thats 3 points. I pick out some new letters ... hmm ... with your n I can spell nucleoplasm thats lets see 40 points. All Ive got is consonants. Im not going to play this stupid game! I hate it!! What a waste of time! What should we play instead? Lets play poker. At least with cards you have half a chance. Ok I bet a nickel. Ill see you ... and raise you 8 dollars.
07/01/92
Calvin has mysteriously shrunk to the size of an insect! His only hope is to call for help! Pushing with all his might Calvin dials the gigantic telephone. Its ringing! He runs to the mouthpiece! Will anyone be able to hear him?? Bzz bz! Bzzzz! Bzz bz! Bzz bz! Calvin this had better not be you.
08/01/92

Glogga muck bluh Spiff! Spiff chug wunka! We join our hero the courageous Spaceman Spiff as he is pursued across the galaxy by hostile aliens! A bolt of Explode-o-Ray explodes behind him! The aliens are closing in! Spiff punches the accelerator and dives towards the mysterious world below! Blasting low over the planets surface at near light speed our hero is horrified to discover the aliens are still on his trail! Spiff has but one desperate chance! He flies through a tight arch hoping the aliens will crash as they follow! Zounds! The ol battleship is surprisingly maneuverable! Dont call me that! And you are going to bed if I have to chase you all night!
13/01/92
Behold the dreaded toboggan: suicide sled. Its unique design sends a blinding spray of snow on its passengers at the slightest bump. Note too the lack of any steering mechanism. Yes this sled is truly a hazard to life and limb. Wheee! Oomph!
14/01/92
Boy is it cold! Cant we turn the heat up? Heat is expensive Calvin. Just put on a sweater. Look the thermostat goes all the way up to 90 degrees! We could be sitting around in our shorts. Leave the thermostat alone Calvin. I can almost see my breath. Ill just crank it up to 75 ok? I said dont touch it. Gee my hands are so numb I cant move the switch. Guess Ill put on a sweater.
15/01/92
Ooh. You look cold Calvin! Theres a fire made. Why dont you go warm up? Oh boy! Nothing beats sitting by a roaring fire after youve been out in the cold. Of course some people say why bother going outside first?
16/01/92
Calvin I hope you took your boots off before you walked across the floor. Of course I did! You dont need to tell me all the time!
17/01/92
Given any more thought to that backyard ski lift proposal of mine? Oh yes. Lots.

Hi Hobbes. are you reading that book I gave you? Yes. Its very good. You like it? Sure I think its ... wait a minute. Would you mind writing it in two pages for me by tomorrow morning?
22/01/92
Mom was I adopted? No why do you ask? Are you planning to put me to work in a cannery for fourteen hours a day when I turn seven? Of course not! Youre not just fattening me up to eat me are you? Good heavens Calvin! Who put all these ridiculous ideas in your head?!? Thats right. Ridiculous ideas she called them. Oh sure you think your moms going to tell you?
23/01/92
Whifffff whiff whiff whiff whiff whiff. For all that preparation you sure are a lousy shot.
24/01/92
Go ahead down. Youll miss all those trees. You can do it. Youll stop before you go over that ledge at the bottom. You wont go into that pond. Besides the ice is probably real thick anyway. Go ahead down. My brain is trying to kill me.
25/01/92
Galosh. Galosh. Galosh.
26/01/92
Im thirsty. AAAUGH. Sleepwalking! Nightmare! Homicidal psycho jungle cat! Hee hee hee! You shouldve seen the look on your face! If Mom and Dad cared about me at ALL theyd buy me some infra-red nighttime vision goggles.

I brought my report card home dad. Well! Lets see it! Remember how you once told me it didnt matter what grades I got ... just as long as I tried my hardest right? Well you could certainly be trying harder than this! So you admit you were lying?
29/01/92
Dad says my report card shows that not enough time is being spent on my homework. So from dinner till bed is now designated as homework time. I dont think thats fair! If it doesnt take that long to do why should I have to stay in my room all that time? Yeah can I help it Im so fast?
30/01/92
Can I have some clay? Help yourself. This stuffs impossible to work with. Thanks. Ive got a pretty good bowl or something going here. It started out as a phantom jet but it sort of squashed so now I think its a bowl. Mmm thats very good. Yeah Im real pleased with it.
31/01/92
Uh oh. Theres a dinosaur in the kitchen. Well if you see Calvin anywhere tell him its almost time for dinner. Id invite you but no dinosaurs are allowed at the dinner table. Ha. Dinosaurs eat anywhere they want.
01/02/92
Lets go Calvin. Time for your bath. Im not taking baths anymore. I hate them. Oh? And how are you going to stay clean? Easy.
02/02/92
GAAAA. It is 0701 hours. You are late. Extra soap today robot three. Mom out. Extra soap affirmative. Attention kitchen. Calvin arriving in turbo chute 4. Clear receiving pad. Ive got a moon meeting today. Ill be home for diner if the shuttle isnt late. Have a good day. See you tonight. Calvin youre going to be late for school! Put on your jacket! Why are you just standing there? Calvin? Calvin?? Honestly! Would you please try to stay in the PRESENT?! Sighhh...
03/02/92
When a kid grows up he has to BE something. He cant just stay the way he is. But a tiger grows up and stays a tiger. Why is that? No room for improvement. Of all the luck my parents had to be humans. Dont take it too hard. Humans provide some very important protein.
04/02/92
Its no surprise to ME that nobodys sold a house on this street for six years.
05/02/92
I try to make television-watching a complete forfeiture of experience. Notice how I keep my jaw slack so my mouth hands open. I try not to swallow either so I drool and I keep my eyes half-focused so I dont use any muscles at all. I take a passive entertainment and extend the passivity to my entire being. I wallow in my lack of participation and response. Im utterly inert. Im going to leave before you start attracting flies. I can almost feel my neural transmitters shutting down.

HELP HELP! MY HEAD SOMEHOW GOT TWISTED COMPLETELY AROUND! IM FACING BACKWARD! LOOK I CAN READ THE TAG ON MY SHIRT! I CAN SEE DOWN MY OWN BACK! ... Oh wait. Theres my belly button. I must have my SHIRT on backward. Never mind. Ive got my head on straight after all. Oh I wouldnt go THAT far.
08/02/92
OH SURE! NICE TRY! Darn darn darn darn darn!
09/02/92
Today is Valentines Day. SO WHAT?! WHO CARES?! NOW ME! Whos your valentine THIS year?? NOBODY! Is it SUSIE?? NO! Ill bet she IS! Ill be your heart beats faster at the sound of her name! Ahh how you long to gaze deep into her shimmering eyes!! WHAT?! Your cheeks are flushed! Your chin quivers to imagine her soft warm lips pressed against yours! Oh to be locked for an eternity in a passionate embrace with sweet sweet Susie! TAKE IT BACK! Can I be Best Tiger? TAKE IT BACK! Have you picked out a ring yet? TAKE IT BACK! Wheres the honeymoon? Hey Calvin! Huh?? You jerk! This is for sending me a Valentine card with a drawing of me as a worm-eaten corpse! Oh HO-O-O! You sent her a CARD?? Doctor Love paging Doctor I.M.N. Love! Id say were about due for another Saint Valentines Day massacre.
10/02/92
Arent you supposed to be doing your homework now? I quit doing homework. Homework is bad for my self-esteem. It is Sure! It sends the message that I dont know enough! All that emphasis on right answers makes me feel bad when I get them wrong. So instead of trying to learn Im just concentrating on liking myself the way I am. Your self-esteem is enhanced by remaining an ignoramus? Please! Lets call it informationally impaired.
11/02/92
See Hobbes we shouldnt need accomplishments to feel good about ourselves. Self-esteem shouldnt be conditional. Thats why Ive stopped doing homework. I dont need to learn things to like myself. Im fine the way I am. So the secret to good self-esteem is to lower your expectations to the point where theyre already met? Right. We should take PRIDE in our mediocrity. Remind me to invest overseas. I think this snowman is good enough dont you?
12/02/92
Look Dad made me do my homework. He said when Im older Ill discover that there are few pleasures greater than learning. So I said FINE Ill learn when Im older. What did HE say? He said if I didnt start cracking books NOW this would be as old as Id get. Sounds like you learned something already.
13/02/92
Mom and Dad drive me crazy. They dont understand ME and I dont understand THEM. Its hopeless! Im related to people I dont relate to.
14/02/92
Here we stand peering down the dizzying depths of doom drop! Do we turn around and retreat to the stupefying security of home and hearth? OR do we brave the descent risk demise and experience the flood of somatic sensation that screams we are alive gloriously alive however temporarily?? ... Hobbes? I thought the question was rhetorical. The other way though!
15/02/92
Heres the latest poll on your standing as Dad. Wonderful. The good news is that you have a high name-recognition factor. All the household six-year-olds polled were able to identify you as Dad. This recognition however is liked to the fact that your policies are universally deplored. Theres talk of voting you out of office and making Mom Dad. I see. And what do YOU know about this? My first act will be to make you do the cooking. Whoa! That changes everything.
16/02/92
15 bucks a glass?! Thats right! Want some? How do you justify charging 15 dollars? Supply and demand. Wheres the demand?! I dont see any demand! Theres LOTs of demand! Yeah? Sure! As the sole stockholder in this enterprise I DEMAND monstrous profit on my investment! And as President and CEO of the company I DEMAND an exorbitant annual salary. And as my own employee I DEMAND a high hourly wage and all sorts of company benefits! And THEN theres overhead and actual production costs! But it looks like you just threw a lemon in some sludge water! Well I have to cut expenses SOMEwhere if I want to stay competitive. What if I got sick from that? Caveat Emptor is the motto we stand behind! Id have to charge more to follow health and environment regulations. Youre out of your mind. Im going home to drink something else. Sure! Put me out of a job! Its you anti-business types who ruin the economy! I need to be subsidized.
17/02/92
Dads calling you. He wasnt? Huh! Well Hobbes took your chair. Sorry. I like my chairs pre-warmed. You ow me.
18/02/92
He knows I hate this.
19/02/92
This is my snow sculpture Bourgeois Buffoon. Can you believe Mom rejected my grant application to continue making these? Why do you need a grant? Im on the cutting edge of art! My work deserves public support! What if the public doesnt like your work? Theyre not SUPPOSED to like it! This is avante-garde stuff! Im criticizing the lowbrows who cant appreciate great art like this! But youll take their money. What do you want me to do suffer?!
20/02/92
This snowman doesnt look especially avant-garde. Actually its VERY avant-garde. This is my new art movement neo-regionalism. Im appealing to popular nostalgia for the simple values of rural america 50 years ago. I figure the public will eat this up and Ill make a fortune. So how is this avant-garde? Its secretly ironic.
21/02/92
Ive concluded that nothing bad I do is my fault. Oh? Right! Being young and impressionable Im the helpless victim of countless bad influences! An unwholesome culture panders to my undeveloped values and pushes me to maleficence. I take no responsibility for my behavior! Im an innocent pawn! Its societys fault! Then you need to build more character. Go shovel the walk. These discussions never go where theyre supposed to.
22/02/92
I see you with that snowball! Go ahead and throw it! Im not scared! You couldnt hit the side of a barn! Cmon throw it! I dare you! POW!! Seriously you could never have done that if my taunts hadnt boosted your adrenalin. I can find only one of your socks.
23/02/92
At 35000 feet the engines of Flight 430 explode for no reason! With plumes of dense smoke trailing from the wings the giant aircraft plummets out of control! Meanwhile a 50 car freight train hits a penny on the rail at 80 miles an hour and jumps the tracks dragging half a million tons of metal into the air behind it! In a freak coincidence both the jet and the train are converging on ONE SPOT.... where tectonic plates in the earths crus have just begun to shift! That spot is the house of farmer Brown who at this moment is unaware of a gas leak as he attempts to light his stove! As he strikes the match he casually glances out the kitchen window. His eye twitches involuntarily. Cant we play something else?
24/02/92
I read that Teddy Roosevelt once said Do what you can with what you have where you are. Thats good advice. Of course I doubt he was in the tub when he said that.
25/02/92
Shovel the walk! Shovel the walk! Thats all Im good for around here. What about my powerful intellect?! My budding genius is being squandered! I aspire to be more than brute slave labor! These hands! These amazing hands are destined to create unreamt-of wonders yet here theyre worn to the bone in unfulfilling drudgery! What a monstrous injustice! Geez dont tell me lunch isnt ready!
26/02/92
DING DONG You really need professional help. What makes you think I did it??
27/02/92
Whats wrong with Easter Island? I LIKE Easter Island.
28/02/92
Hello is this the hardware sotre? Yes Im wondering if you sell catapults. No?? Well Im looking for something that can deliver a 50-pound payload of snow on a small feminine target. Can you suggest something? Hello? I dont understand how some of these places stay in business.
29/02/92
I dont think you have enough to do.
01/03/92
It all boils down to luck Hobbes. Some people are born lucky and some people are born Unlucky. Either way theres nothing you can do about it. You cant fight luck. Were headed for that cliff! YIKES! Bad luck! bye. See what I meen?! You go along minding your own business and suddenly your luck runs out. If youre-OW-unlucky what can you do? OW! Youre condemned to suffer! OW! Ooh right in the pricker bushes. ...just like yesterday. Maybe my luck will change tomorrow.

03/03/92
If there are no questions well move on to the next chapter. I have a question. Certainly Calvin. What is it? Whats the point of human existence? I meant any questions about the subject at hand. Oh. Frankly Id like to have the issue resolved before I expend any more energy on this.
04/03/92
Ewww. Ewwww. Ewwwwww. EWWWWWW!
05/03/92
Where ARE those darn boots?
06/03/92
Put on some nice clothes and lets go for a stroll!
07/03/92
It couldnt be avoided.
08/03/92
Hi Mom! Ha ha! Im up! Im up! HEY! Get back in bed! I mean it Calvin! Its too late for this nonsense! Wheeee! Im gonna watch TV! Ha ha ha! Calvin stop this! You go straight to bed! NO! Youre in big trouble young man! Youll never catch me! GOTCHA! WAAUGH! I dont WANNA go to bed! I wanna stay UP! Put me down! Let go! Im not tired! AAAAAA! Mom has to EARN a nights respite from me.
09/03/92
rrRumRumm beep beep - rrrrrr rrummm - aughh! - I dont understand why you have to take your clothes off to play cars. Its very weird. Just give em here. Ok?
10/03/92
What time is it? Go look at the clock and see. Whats the weather outside like today? Go step outside and see. How fast can our car go? Go... ...nice try. Phooey.
11/03/92
The problem with rocknroll is that the generation that created it is now the establishment. Rock pretends its still rebellious with its video posturing but who believes it? The stars are 45-year-old zillionaires or they endorse soft drinks! The revolution is a capitalist industry! Give me a break! Fortunately Ive found some protest music for TODAYs youth! This stuff really offends Mom and Dad! Easy-listening muzak? I play it real quiet too.
12/03/92
I dont want to go to school! Id rather do ANYTHING than go to school! OK how about if I go to school and YOU get a job? Youll like working till evening and being responsible for the subsistence of your family with a whiny kids griping for reward. Its nice to know theres so much in life to look forward to.
13/03/92
I dont want to pay any dues in life. I want to be a one-in-a-million overnight success! I want the world handed to me on a silver platter! Good luck. SURELY YOU CONCEDE I DESERVE IT!
14/03/92
*snap* AUGH! Oops! Instinct kicked in before I knew that was you. YOU KNEW DARN WELL THAT WAS ME!
15/03/92
...BLECCHH... ! EEP! YIKES! HELLP!! WAAUGH! UGHH URGLE GACKKH ORG PLUTCH SPLUTCH BLUTCH URRRPP THPPTHH. Uggh how revolting. At least it worked. Lets dance! Darling! YOURE TRYING TO KILL ME WITH THIS STUFF ARENT YOU?! JUST ADMIT IT!! If you dont like it dont eat it. But Im not fixing you something different.
16/03/92
I wish I was still in bed. Id hear the wind bowling the rain against the window panes and Id pull the blankets up get all toasty and cozy and fall back asleep. Instead Im out here cold and wet waiting for the school bus to take me to the gulag. Yeah I hope the sheets are still warm when I get back in. Rub it in Hobbes.
17/03/92
Hey Dad look at this commercial. How come you dont drive a cool sports car like that guy? That car costs $40000. And look at the babe hes with. How come Mom doesnt dress like that? Yeah why DONT you dress like that? Because your adolescent fantasies require an adolescent model with implants ... HONEY. Maybe you guys need to drink more beer.
18/03/92
Mom can I have some money to buy a satan-worshiping suicide-advocating heavy metal album? Calvin the fact that these abnds havent killed themselves in ritual self-sacrifice shows that theyre just in it for the money like everyone else. Its all for effect. If you want to shock and provoke be sincere about it. Mainstream commercial nihilism cant be trusted?! fraid not kiddo. Childhood is so disillusioning.
19/03/92
People dont realize what a burden it is being a genius like me. Its not easy having a mind that operates on a higher plane than everyone elses! People just refuse to see that Im the crux of all history a boy of destiny! I suppose one could recognize a boy of destiny by his planet-and-star underpants. Another trenchant comment by a jealous lesser intellect.
20/03/92
Mom from now on I dont want to be introduced to people as plain Calvin. I want to be introduced as Calvin boy of destiny. Boy of destiny?? But you have to say it right. Pause a little after boy and say destiny a bit slower and deeper for emphasis. Sai it Boy... of DESSSTINY like that! I think Im going to stop introducing you altogether. I wish you had some cymbals to crash after you said it.
21/03/92
Heres your paper Susie. Very good. Here is yours Calvin. By the way you can stop signing your work Calvin boy of destiny and I think your time would be better spend studying than drawing official notary seals at the bottom. Boy of destiny?! Thats right. Boy of destiny! Everyone I know thinks your destiny is a private cage in the primate house. YOUR destiny is to have a smile thats all gums.
22/03/92
Wow! A dime! BONK! MMF OOF. He would just love me to believe that somersault was intentional and innocent.
23/03/92
SMASH ping ping ping kritch krunch. Hes a tricky devil but Ill get him sooner or later! Apparantly I rate just below BUGS with her! And she complains you dont help out around the house.
24/03/92
Wimp! Oh... OH YEAH?? What REALLY bugs me is knowing Ill probably come up with a much sharper retort sometime tonight.
25/03/92
Calvin can you tell us what Lewis and Clark did? No but I can recite the secret superhero origin of each member of Captain Napalms thermo-nuclear league of libery. See me after class Calvin. Im not dumb. I just have a command of thoroughly useless information.
26/03/92
Did you even read the history chapter I assigned? I tried to Miss Wormwood. But the book publisher didnt use the proper print fixative. Needless to say when I picked up the book all the letters slid off the pages and fell on the floor in a heap of gibberish. I think my excuses need to be less extemporaenous.
27/03/92
County library? Reference desk please? Hello? Yes I need a word definition. Well thats the problem. I dont know how to spell it and Im not allowed to say it. Could you just rattle off all the swear words you know and Ill stop you when... hello? See if I ever vote for their tax levies.
28/03/92
I dont need a bath! I can stay clean without one! Look Ill LICK myself clean! Thats what Hobbes does! See Im getting clean just like him! Nice going.
29/03/92
That certainly was a grim spectacle. I LIKE breakfast on the run. But Mom its their NATURE! Why cant you eat at the table like a civilized human being?!
30/03/92
You have a question Calvin? Yes! What assurance do I have that this education is adequately preparing me for the 21st century? Am I getting the skills Ill need to effectively compete in a tough global economy? I want a high-paying job when I get out of here! I want opportunity! In that case young man I suggest you start working harder. What you get out of school depends on what you put into it. Oh. Then forget it.
31/03/92
Whatcha doing? Dad wants to mow the lawn so hes making me pick up sticks. He said I might learn something about the satisfaction that comes from a job well done. And did you? I suppose so. I think hes trying to tell me there is none.
01/04/92
My tiger is deep in somnolent sleep dreaming of chases remembered! His keen eyes are glinting! He dreams of a sprinting Sambar wholl soon be dismembered! Hmmmmmmm
02/04/92
This article says that by age six most children have watched 5000 hours of TV - a quarter of their waking lives! I havent watched that much! Think of all the great shows Ive missed! Ive been deprived of cultural references! Im ignorant of countless amazing products! Hurry! If I watch TV until bedtime I can get in a few precious extra hours and catch up a bit! Remedial vegetation. Help me learn this theme song OK?
03/04/92
I think our newspaper needs a new advice columnist so Im applying for the job. See Ive written some sample answers to people who write in. Stop whining and get a life bozo. Dont tell ME your stupid problems. Ive got plenty of my own. Go soak your head you big baby. Want some advice? Drop dead. I guess that covers about everything. Can you imagine doing this for MONEY? What a racket!
04/04/92
Who ees thees Kahlveen?
05/04/92
Oh man there goes the game! What a dumb sport. I hate baseball. Whats the use of trying? I havent started around the ba-ases yet! Huh? La de da da! Im walkinnnngg! Oh look at the pretty flower! I think Ill stop and smell it! Uh oh! My shoes untied! Better have a seat and tie it! Now Im hopping backwards! Look at me! Im crawling! Im a tiny little inchworm moving an inch at a time! Inchy-squinchy! Inchy-squinchy! AAAIEEE Whoop! Too late! Home run! Stitches for Hobbes bandages for you... how on earth do you DO this to yourself? Dont feel sorry for HIM! He -ow- DESERVED it!
06/04/92
Do you believe in the devil? You know a supreme evil being dedicated to the temptation corruption and destruction of man? Im not sure man needs the help. You just cant talk to animals about these things.
07/04/92
Whats this? Try it. Whats in here? Grubs?? Try it. That means Im going to hate it right? JUST TRY IT! Shes mad because I broke her code.
08/04/92
If Ive learned one thing in life its that everyone has his price. Raise the ante high enough and theres no such thing as scruples! People will do ANYthing if the price is right! Whats YOUR price? Two bucks cold cash up front. I dont know which is worse... that everyone has his price or that the price is always so low. Id make mine higher but its hard to find buyers as it is.
09/04/92
Whatcha doin Dad? Im busy trying to fix something. Why bother? On the rare occasions when you know what the problem is you usually make it worse and hurt yourself in the process! I wish Id noticed the bandage on his hand before I said that.
10/04/92
Im going on a bike ride. Whats so funny? Nothing. Have a good time. Look I didnt design this outfit! Its PRACTICAL! Hey Dad howd you get your head stuck in a bowling ball? Ha! Next time Ill squirt them both with my water bottle.
11/04/92
Tigers have no ambition no drive! They dont accomplish anything! How do you justify yourself?!

13/04/92
Ive decided to believe in astrology and horoscopes. Really? You bet. It only makes sense that every facet of our daily lives should depend upon the position of celestial bodies hundreds of millions of miles away. Look here. Today Ill have many key policies implemented. I get to have my way! Oh those mischievous planets. The newspaper couldnt print it if it werent true!
14/04/92
My horoscope says Turnabout means circumstances in your favour. Assert views in a confident manner. Lunar cycle high many of your key policies will be implemented. Isnt that great? Today Im fated to get my way! The heavens decree it! So what are your key policies? First obviously is Dont do homework. Cmon lets go out and play! Here comes your Mom and it looks like she has a bone to pick with the moon. Ha! Watch me assert my views in a confident manner!
15/04/92
Your Mom didnt care much about the lunar sanction of your no-homework policy did she? Hmph. Well my horoscope said Many key policies will be implement. Not ALL of them. Besides it says to expect a turnabout in my favor. Mom will relent next time for sure. What are your other key policies then? No baths stay up late dont go to school... THESE are the ones that will be implemented. Maybe the astrologer was looking through the wrong end of the telescope. Cmon moon do your stuff!
16/04/92
I thought I told you to take your bath. Sorry Mom. You have no say in this. Youre in for a big surprise buster. Circumstances are going to turn in my favor! Thats what my horosscope says! All human affairs are determined by stars and planets and today they say my key policies will be implemented. That means no bath and no bedtime! By golly its not good to thwart the intentions of the universe! Fate just isnt what it used to be.
17/04/92
I dont understand this! Not a single part of my horoscope came true! My policies werent implemented and circumstances didnt turn in my favor! Just the opposite in fact! What went wrong?! I thought this stuff was based on planets and stars! How could those be misread? What kind of science IS this?! Im sure any scientist would give you a categorical answer. Maybe tomorrows horoscope will run a correction and apology.
18/04/92
Did todays horoscope print a retraction of yesterdays prediction? No theres just a new one for today. Whats it say? Yours says Popularity zooms upward. New encounters pay big dividends. Hmm thats good. Wait it goes on. Emphasize romance. Opposite sex finds you irresistible. Lucky day for love. OH NO! I bet I know what the big dividends are! Woo woo woo!
19/04/92
Whatcha doin? Getting rich! Really? Yep. Im writing a self-help book! Theres a huge market for this stuff. First you convince people theres something wrong with them. Thats easy because advertising has already conditioned people to feel more insecure about their weight looks social status sex appeal and so on. Next you convince them that the problem is not their fault and that theyre victims of larger forces. Thats easy because its what people believe anyway. Nobody wants to be responsible for his own situation. Finally you convince them that with your expert advice and encouragement they can conquer their problem and be happy! Ingenious. What problem will YOU help people solve? Their addiction to self-help books! My book is called Shut Up And Stop Whining: How To Do Something With Your Life Besides Think About Yourself. You probably should wait for the advance before you buy anything. The trouble is... if my program works I wont be able to write a sequel.
20/04/92
Dont make me go to school! Please dont make me! Help! Leggo! Ow! Stop! You dont understand! My horoscope says Im irresistible to girls today! Im too popular! Im going to get big dividends! Augghhh! What if Susie kisses me?! I dont want romance! I hate Susie! Call me in sick! Help! Dear I got him! Grab his feet while I pry his fingers loose! PUH-LEEZE!! I wonder what it would cost to rent a place in town.
21/04/92
Maybe todays horoscope wont come true. I dont WANT a lucky day for love! Opposite sex finds you irresistible. Hee hee hee! I dont believe in astrology any more! Its all phony! Yeah thats right! Much smoochies! Mm-mm! Yow wow! Stop it! Yesterdays predictions didnt come true so Im sure todays wont either! Im not worried! Whens the wedding?? Should I wear my spats?? In a minute youll be wearing a BODY CAST! TRY it lover boy! Well see how you kiss girls with a fat lip!
22/04/92
Take it back! Im never getting married! Never! Love em and leave em eh? You rake! That does it! Im gonna knock you into next week! Wait! Wait! Susies coming! What? She is? AUGH! She IS! Ive got to discourage romance! You cant! Smoldering passion is your fate! Gosh Calvin the dirt covering your features is a big improvement. Oh no its true! Im a love magnet!
23/04/92
Stay away Susie! I dont want any big dividends got it? Dont listen to Hobbes! What? The stars and the planets are doing this! I cant help it! My aura is uncontrollable! What? Its the bus! The bus is here! Whee! Im safe! You cant do anything now! Ha ha! Im off to school! Hoorayy! What? The way Calvins brain is wired you can almost hear the fuses blowing.
24/04/92
So Susie didnt kiss you today? Nope! In fact I put a worm in her hair she knocked me down and kicked me in the shins! That doesnt sound like zooming popularity. Nope! My horoscope was completely wrong again! The planets obviously have no influence on me! What a relief to know my life isnt controlled by outside forces! Im the master of my own fate! ... to a point of course. The paper should print MOMs daily predictions. THOSE sure come true.
25/04/92
Ive been thinking about this astrology stuff. Everyone wants to know what the future holds but you just have to wait till it happens. So really the best preparation for the future is to take the present and ... WHOOP! AAUGHH! ... think about what youre doing? No get yourself a good luck charm. Man here comes ANOTHER bath!
26/04/92
HELP HELP ACK OFF MMF! UMF GAKK RRRGGH Grrrr YIPE! WAAAA! SCREEECH NNNG AAAAAAAAAAAA. Thanks for the helmet Dad. Do they sell long-range offensive weapons? Looks like youve been building some character!
27/04/92
Hey Mom can I get some plastic surgery? All the celebrities do it! Honey celebrities need the fat sucked out of their brains not their bottoms. What on earth do you want changed? Youre fine the way you are! I want another eye put in my forehead.
28/04/92
I think we need a new policy in this house. And whats that? From now on whenever you tell me things I dont want to hear any reasons explanations subtlety or context. I just want ten-second sound bites OK? So much for THAT policy.
29/04/92
For school were supposed to write a paragraph about what our Dads do. Dad: the paragraph. Catchy title huh? What does my Dad do? Mostly he gets on my nerves. The end. You may get a point for succinctness. Well what else is there to say?!
30/04/92
Bad news Dad. The character issue is killing you in the polls. WHAT character issue?! Ive got GREAT character! Ive got character up to here! Thats what we hate. My only flaw is a preternatural intolerence of pesky kids.
01/05/92
Paul Gauguin asked Whence do we come? What are we? Where are we going? Well I dont know about anyone else but I came from my room Im a kid with big plans and Im going outside! See ya later! Say who the heck is Paul Gauguin anyway?
02/05/92
Look at THIS Dad! Ive got five dollars in here! Im rich! Ive been saving my change for weeks and weeks and look how much Ive got! Guess what Im going to do with it! Open a savings account? Ill bet I know why you guys dont get invited to parties. Every time you make a deposit you can think Oh boy another two minutes at college.
03/05/92
I love summer! Three whole months with no responsibilities! Theres nothing we have to do! They say idle hands are the devils workshop. I resent that! We work darn hard at this.
04/05/92
My gum has lost its flavor. When that happens I dont spit it out. I just add a new piece. After a few packs its like chewing a big soggy sock! My jaws ache and I cant close my lips so I wheeze through my open mouth and drool! An orifice is an amusing thing all right. Ith funny how you neffa thee gwown-upth do thith.
05/05/92
Oh boy the new issue of Chewing! You get a magazine? Wow this looks great! Special sugarless gum issue - hcoosing an artificial sweetener thats right for YOU... Tongue exercises for bigger bubbles... Rad fashion kneepads for walking and chewing... PLUS an interview with Bazooka Joe! See its all target marketing! Advertisers dont waste their time on mass audiences any more. They find your special interest and they nail you! As if advertising wasnt intrusive enough before. Ooh the 92 spearmints are out! I gotta get to a store!
06/05/92
I cant believe theres a magazine for gum chewers. Heck there must be a DOZEN such magazines. Each appeals to a different faction. Chewing is high-gloss literate and sophisticated. Gum Action goes for the gonzo chewers. Chewers Illustrated aims at the vintage gum collectors and so on! Each one encourages you to think you belong to an elite clique so advertisers can appeal to your ego and get you to cultivate an image that sets you apart from the crowd. Its the divide and conquer trick. I wonder whatever happened to the melting pot. Theres no money in it.
07/05/92
Heres an interesting article. The top five gum brands are compared in terms of flavor retention elasticity bubble capacity and chewing rebound. The computer graph shows the results compensating for various saliva acidities. If you know your pH this really helps you choose the proper gum for your chewing style. What kind of nut would CARE about all this?! EVERYONE! This is hard data! It lets you quantify your enjoyment! I thought fun was supposed be FUN. Well I prefer to trust the experts.
08/05/92
Heres an ad for a new gum called Hyperbubble and it says If youre not chewing Hyperbubble you might as well be chewing cud. Ooh great copy! Gosh am I cool enough to chew Hyperbubble? Maybe Im NOT! Maybe if you chew Hyperbubble you BECOME cool! Or maybe if you chew it everyone ASSUMES youre cool is it doesnt matter if you are or not! What do you think? Should I buy some? If your emotional security depends on satisfying a need you didnt have until you read the ad go ahead. I think I will! Boy Im glad I get this magazine!
09/05/92
YAHHH! RRGGHH munch munch munch. Youre right. Food DOES taste better this way.

The fearless Spaceman Spiff descends toward the mysterious planet below! Our heros bizarrotron indicates the presence of aliens! Spiff sets out to investigate! Crouching behind a boulder our hero hears alien voices... talking about HIM! BLORG GABLORD SPIFF! HA HA! Spiff bursts into the open death ray blaster blansting! Ill give you something to talk about! he yells! Excuse me a moment. Back in the darkness of outer space Spiff reflects on his one miscalculation. Our hero resolves to revisit the planet THIS time with more ammo! No sleep tonight I see.
11/05/92
As I the maniacal tyrant look down upon my mathetic subjects... I reflect on how their puny lives mean nothing to me except as the brute labor necessary to execute my mad designs! My lunatic whims are their laws! Ha ha ha! I thought I told you to gather the trash. Being a parent must be nice.
12/05/92
Outta my way Twinky. A person cant be a doormat unless he allows himself to be one! I refuse to budge! SHOVE. Ack! Off! Ugh! Ive got to stop reading those dumb advice columns.
13/05/92
RINGG RINNG. Hello we are unable to come to the phone right now... ...so please leave a message at the sound of the click. *CLICK*
14/05/92
Most people just muddle through their lives! Theyre passive and unmotivated! They lack ambition and drive! Not ME though! Im going to have an EPIC life! Im going to wrestle the issue of the age and change the course of history! How are you going to do that? Im going to sit here and wait so opportunity will know where to find me when its time to change the world. I wish Id brought a book to read. Naah itll be any minute now.
15/05/92
OUT! DARN!
16/05/92
Our country was founded a very long time ago roughly around 200 B.C. 200 B.C.?! Before Calvin. THATS WHATS IMPORTANT!
17/05/92
Calvin I spent over an hour fixing this! At least TRY it! I saw what went in it! Im not touching it!
18/05/92
When I grow up Im not going to read the newspaper and Im not going to follow complex issues and Im not going to vote. That way I can complain that the government doesnt represent me. Then when everything goes down the tubes I can say the system doesnt work and justify my further lack of participation. An ingeniously self-fulfilling plan. Its a lot more fun to blame things than to fix them.
19/05/92
Aw gee did the darn ol sun move some MORE?? Oh hush.
20/05/92
This is the worst assignment ever! Im supposed to think up a story write it and illustrate it by tomorrow! Do I look like a novelist?! This is impossible! I cant tell stories! What about your explanation of the noodle incident? THAT WASNT A STORY! THAT WAS THE UNVARNISHED TRUTH! Oh dont be so modest. You deserved a Pulitzer.
21/05/92
Do you have an idea for your story yet? No Im waiting for inspiration. You cant just turn on creativity like a faucet. You have to be in the right mood. What mood is that? Last-minute panic.
22/05/92
If you ask ME these assignments dont teach you how to write. They teach you how to HATE to write. Deadlines rules how to do it grades... how can you be creating when someones breathing down your neck? I guess you should try not to think about the end result too much and just have fun with the process of creating. Every time I do that I end up in the school psychologists office. Well maybe not THAT much fun.
23/05/92
Say IVE got an idea! For your story? No I thought of a way I wont have to write one! Oh no. Hop in the time machine Hobbes! Were going a few hours into the future! Ill have finished my story by then so well just pick it up and bring it back to the present! That way I wont have to write it! Something doesnt make sense here and I think its me sitting in this box. Relax! Well be back as soon as we go.
24/05/92
Thank you. Thank YOU. Yep. Theres nothing like a big bed for dancing. I hope your parents dont mind bad springs.
25/05/92
Vortex goggles on? Here we go! Well jump ahead to my bedtime and pick up my completed homework from my own future! Then well return to the present and we can goof off the rest of the evening! Here we are! You must be the 8:30 Calvin. Did you have a good trip? No. Pst! Why do you always go on these things?
26/05/92
Greetings 8:30 Calvin and Hobbes! Im 6:30 Calvin and this is 6:30 Hobbes! Charmed. Well since were YOU from the past I suppose you know why were here. Did you do the homework? Me?? No. NO?! Why not?? Because two hours ago I went to the future to get it. Yeah and here I am! Where is it?! Thats what I said two hours ago! I knew this would never work. Right as always Hobbes.
27/05/92
Do you mean to say its time for bed and you still havent written our story for school?! I figured the story was already done! How could it be done if YOU didnt write it?! Obviously it had to be done before now because its 8:30 and Im supposed to be in bed! Wait a minute! If the story had been written in YOUR past that would mean I shouldve written it! Well why didnt you?! Because I came to the future to pick it up when it was DONE! If you hadnt screwed up my past your future wouldnt be like this.
28/05/92
Hold it. Lets figure this out. IM you at 6:30 and YOURE me at 8:30. Neither of us did the homework. Right. That means the homework SHOULDVE been done between my time and your time. Right. We needed to do it at 7:30. But the 7:30 Calvin clearly didnt do it or youd have it by now at 8:30. Yeah! This is HIS fault! That lazy little punk! Hell get us BOTH in trouble! Lets go get him!
29/05/92
Hobbeses the 8:30 Calvin and I are going to go back to 7:30 and make THAT Calvin do the homework. Well wait here. All this time travel makes us queasy. Well be right back. Off we go! This HAS to be the least efficient way to write a paper. All this modern technology makes people try to do everything at once.
30/05/92
Ah ha! Here we are right at 7:30! Yikes! My past and my future! Put down that comic book and do our homework! Yeah! Get to work you loafer! Hey! Why should I do all the work? Either of you could do it too! But I didnt at 6:30 and now its 7:30. And at 8:30 it will be too late. Youre the last chance. Now are you gonna start writing or do we have to pound you? Go ahead and hit me! My FUTURE self will be the one who hurts! HEY!
31/05/92
I dont think so. Definitely not. Mm... nahh... Thats a little better. Eww. Yeah perfect! What now Calvin? No absolutely not. Put those back. Mom says no way. Grown-ups have no taste.
01/06/92
You know Hobbes if the 7:30 Calvin is at all like the 6:30 and 8:30 Calvins Ill bet he isnt going to write that story. Youre right Hobbes. Why dont WE write a story while were waiting for them? Yeah! Calvin could use it for his class then. Ill write it down and you can illustrate it! OK now what should our story be about? Calvins not here. Lets write about HIM! Hee hee hee! Hoo hoo! Drawing Calvin is easy! You just make a big mouth and add some hair!
02/06/92
Look guys you cant gang up on ME! Oh yeah? Why not? Because were all the same Calvin! In one hour the 6:30 Calvin will be ME and in another hour well BOTH be the 8:30 Calvin. That means you guys will suffer whatever you do to me. Oh yeah. Oops. Whose dumb idea was this anyway? His? His!
03/06/92
Were back but we didnt get the homework. Now its 8:30 again and were doomed. Here you go! Hobbes and I wrote a story for you while you were gone! You DID?? Ha ha! Were all done! We can go back to 6:30 now! Thanks Hobbeses! You guys are life savers! Calvin? Its Mom! Hurry! Hobbes get in! Well be you in a couple hours! So long! Arent you in bed yet? Dont come in! Im... uh... changing into my PJs!
04/06/92
Did you write your story for class tomorrow? Sort of. What do you mean sort of? Well Hobbes helped and I had to do a lot of time traveling. Is your story written or not? Oh its written. I just havent read it.
05/06/92
All right Calvin go ahead. Whats YOUR story about? I dont know yet but Im sure its good! My story is entitled How Hobbes the handsome tiger saved the day... ...no thanks to Calvin the time-traveling chowderhead. WHAT?! Is there a problem? There WILL be for a certain stripey furball when I get home.
06/06/92
OK YOU! Me?? This story you wrote is about ME trying to get OUT of writing the STORY! You made my time traveling sound like LUNACY! And the illustration You drew the THREE of me fighting! I was the laughing-stock of the whole class! What grade did it get? Um... A+. She wrote Very creative. The tiger narration was a clever touch. Im glad youre finally applying yourself. ... BUT EVEN SO...!! A+? Maybe I should send this to the New Yorker.
07/06/92
A solitary zokk circles high in the sweltering skies of a desert planet. Below a thin plume of smoke rises from the wreckage of a small red spacecraft. Our hero the intrepid Spaceman Spiff crawls across the sun-baked land! He... he must find shelter! Wait! Something is approaching! Is it a mirage? Goodness put on some sun screen and wear a hat if youre going to be out here. Honestly show a little common sense. And dont give me that look. Spiff survives fixes his ship and sets off to find a more temperate planet with fewer aliens.
08/06/92
Baseball is an intelligent sport. Theres more to it than brute force. It may seem slow but thats because its a thinking mans game. Theres a lot of strategy to consider. Especially the way WE play! Right! Now the first person to discover twelfth base gets a ghost point and one free Get out of jail...
09/06/92
Youll be proud to know Im going to donate all the snot I sneeze to hospitals for mucus transfusions. Oh stop being disgusting Calvin! Nobody needs THAT donated! What an idea! Oh. I have a jar for you to wash.
10/06/92
Dad where do babies come from? Is it true a stork leaves them swaddled in a bundle on the front step? In most cases yes but YOU were unceremoniously dumped down the chimney by a big hairy pterodactyl. COOL! Explains a lot doesnt it?
11/06/92
All? Eez thees der pooblic lahbrorry? Yah! I em beeg eemportant rezearcher oond I require eenglish voolgar zynonyms for disgustink body vunktions yah? Allo? Allo? No luck? Those librarians are a sharp bunch.

This town just aint big enough few the both of us! Yep I reckon well have to annex part o the county! Mom wont let us play with guns. I get to be the zoning board!
13/06/92
BUH-URRRRRRRRRRP! Good HEAVENS Calvin! What do you say after that?! Great diaphragm control huh? Shell be sorry when Im a famous soloist for the orchestra. Maybe she thinks your pitch is off.
14/06/92
CALLLVINN! Moms calling start the stopwatch. Shouldnt you answer her? CALLVINNN! Not yet. She doesnt see us so she cant prove we heard her. The trick is to listen to her tone of voice and answer just before she gets mad enough to come looking for us. CALVIN!! OK that was it. Now we play innocent. ARE YOU CALLING ME?? Come inside. Its time for bed. Its getting dark. Ha! She made a tactical blunder! Darkness is relative! ITS NOT DARK! YES IT IS. COME INSIDE. I CAN STILL SEE MY HANDS! ITS NOT REAL DARK! ITS DARK ENOUGH. LETS GO. Rats she cut off the debate before we could really define the terms. Now we have to bargin. CAN I STAY OUT ANOTHER TEN MINUTES? THATS ALL I WANT! NO COME IN NOW. FIVE MINUTES THEN! JUST FIVE MINUTES OK? NOW CALVIN! Darn shes catching on! She guessed that MY five minutes is HER half-hour. Well go for the fake agreement. OK IM COMING! Now we can stay out a little longer before she realizes I lied. Hows the time? Weve dragged this out 53 seconds so far. Good lets go for the record! Oops I lost my shoe! Every minute outside and awake is a GOOD minute.
15/06/92
This is the dumbest thing Ive ever seen in my life! Yeah well go soak your head! HEY THATLL BE ONE DOLLAR!
16/06/92
How do I know your ideas are great? It says so on my sign. Want one? I dont have a dollar. No problem! You can put 50 cents down and pay 100% interest in dime installments over the next 10 days! People just dont know a reat idea when they hear one.
17/06/92
Im having an inventory reduction sale! Great ideas are now just a quarter! OK here. Whats your great idea? Buy some more! Im getting another great idea right now. Me too. See ya.
18/06/92
Ahh another bowl of chocolate frosted sugar bombs! The seocnd bowl is always the best! The pleasure of my FIRST bowl is diminished by the anticipation of future bowls... ...and by the end of my THIRD bowl I usually feel sick. Maybe you shouldnt use chocolate milk. I tried cola but the bubbles went up my nose.
19/06/92
You call this NEWS?! THIS isnt informative! This is a sound bite! This is entertainment! This is sensationalism! Fortunately thats all I have the patience for.
20/06/92
Well lets check my calendar and see what our schedule is for today. Today says Do nothing. So does tomorrow and every day after... all the way through the end of August. I LIKE this itinerary! Lets get right to it!
21/06/92
A bee nest! I hate bees! WHAP ZZZZZZZ AIEE! AAAAAAAAA YOWW! I dont see the harpoon that gored you but this will help the sting. Call the national guard. Im sure they can track the bee on radar.
22/06/92
Mom got me some clay! Want to help me make something? Do we get smocks? I want a smock! This kind of clay isnt that messy. You dont need a smock. I WANT A SMOCK! Ok ok you can have a smock! Lets get a marker and write Dont knock my smock or Ill clean your clock. I guess it wouldnt show if dad wore his suit coat.
23/06/92
I like my smock. Good. ...OK Ill divide up the clay. Heres yours. You can tell the quality of the artist by the quality of his smock. Uh huh... you have to work this stuff a bit to get it soft. Actually I just like to SAY smock. See just knead it like so and then it can be modeled. Smock smock smock smock smock smock! WHAT ON EARTH IS WRONG WITH YOU?!
24/06/92
Fine art is dead Hobbes. Nobody understands it. Nobody likes it. Nobody sees it. Its irrelevant in todays culture. If you want to influence people POPULAR art is the way to go. Mass market commercial art is the future. Besides its the only way to make serious money and thats whats important about being an artist. So what kind of sculpture are you making? Please! Its not a sculpture. Its collectible figurines.
25/06/92
See the problem with fine art is that its supposed to express original truths. But who likes originality and truth?! Nobody! Lifes hard enough without it! Only an idiot would PAY for it! But POPULAR art knows the customer is always right! People want more of what they already know they like so popular art gives it to em! And how ARE the movie sequels this summer? Great! Man theres nothing I hate more than paying five bucks and having to deal with some new plot.
26/06/92
There I made a tiger. THATS no good! Whos going to buy something like that?! Its subtle! Its boring! Its incomprehensible! How will this ever appeal to the lowest common denominator?! Its completely unadaptable to merchendising tie-ins! Who cares? I just wanted to make it. WHAT?! IS THIS SOME SNOBBY ELITIST AESTETIC THING?!?
27/06/92
Look at the dopey clay tiger Hobbes made. Gee Calvin I think this is good. You LIKE it?? Wheres the marketabiity? Ask Hobbes if we can put it on the coffee table. But look what I made! A hundred shrunken heads of popular cartoon characters! Eww you stitched their mouths shut?! Gloat now cause some day Ill be a lot richer than you. I call it Symphony in Orange No. 1.
28/06/92
Summer days are supposed to be longer but they sure seem short to me. Ill say. We didnt get to do half our itinerary.
29/06/92
Suse stay right there! I want to show you something. Its a surprise so close your eyes. Ill be right back. Dont move. Oh cover your nose so you dont smell anything OK? Thats real important. And all your clothes are washable right? Doggone it nobodys going to be her friend if she wont TRUST anyone.
30/06/92
If people sat outside and looked at the stars each night Ill bet theyd live a lot differently. How so? Well when you look into infinity you realize that there are more important things to do than what people do all day. We spent OUR day looking under rocks in the creek. I mean OTHER people.
01/07/92
Mom I have a question. Sure Honey. Why would it be worth four dollars a minute to talk on the telephone to goofy ladies who wear their underwear on TV commercials? When were you watching that?! Um... It was on... uh... during my morning cartoons. Somehow whenever I ask a question I end up with lots of them to answer.
02/07/92
Lets not play this any more hmm? Its not MY fault you make a very big frog!
03/07/92
What are you doing inside? Its a beautiful day out! Go move around! HEY! Its too hot! Its too bright! Its too humid! Its too buggy! ITS TOO REAL!
04/07/92
Heh heh heh! Heh heh heh! I wish I had more enemies. Im sure you will someday honey.
05/07/92
I wish we could stop summer right here and have the days stay the same way they are. Thats the problem with life. It rolls along with speed you cant control. You cant go faster or slower. Fun experiences always go roaring by. ...while bad experiences never pass quickly enough. I wish we could choose how fast and slow events go. For example Id like to speed up childhood and get up to driving age. Its not the pace of life I mind. Its the sudden stop at the end.
06/07/92
Boy theres nothing worse than an inscrutable omen.
07/07/92
I saw a cloud that looked just like me! Really? There was a head huge and white floating in the ethereal blue! Obviously its a SIGN! Of what? Very peculiar high altitude winds I guess. Science kind of takes the fun out of the portent business. You know some sort of cumulonimbal thing.
08/07/92
Hi Dad its me Calvin. I just called to let you know its a perfect day outside. Too bad youre trapped in a boring office while Im running around free with no responsibilities! Have a good summer! Ha ha ha! *click* Childhood is for spoiling adulthood.
09/07/92
People are so self-centered. The world would be a better place if people would stop thinking about themselves and focus on others for a change. Gee I wonder who that might apply to. Me! Everyone should focus more on ME!
10/07/92
Here I am all set to write my autobiography and Im stuck! Whats the problem? I cant remember the first half of my life! Maybe your Mom knows what you did. I asked her. She said I did revolting things that are probably unpublishable. Well no wonder you suppressed the memories. Maybe I was in jail!
11/07/92
The problem with tigers is they have no setting between Off and High.
12/07/92
I read another article whining about how much violence is on television. So Ive seen a few thousand homicides in my day! Whats the big deal?! Its my RIGHT to watch violence on TV! Its people like me who make these programs profitable! I say the consumer is always right and if the advertisers want me to watch TV the shows had better pander to my tastes! ... and frankly I like to watch shoot outs car wrecks fist fights and grisly muders! I like to be ENTERTAINED! Dont you worry that all this violence is desensitizing? Nahh. Id like to shoot the idiots who think this stuff affects me.
13/07/92
I let my mind wander a bit and it didnt come back. I figured youd lost your mind years ago.
14/07/92
Bugs fly in such crazy loops and zigzags. I wonder why they dont get dizzy and barf. Maybe they do! Eww gross! Ha ha ha! But then why would they keep flying that way? Maybe bugs LIKE to barf! EWWWW! They WOULD!! Ha ha ha ha! Blaugh! I tell you Hobbes its great to have a friend who appreciates an earnest discussion of ideas.
15/07/92
What if we die and it turns out our God is a big CHICKEN?? What then?! Just eat your dinner OK? ETERNAL CONSEQUENCES THATS WHAT!
16/07/92
One of the joys of being a kid is that experiences are new and therefore more intense. For example Im about to stick my nose in a jar of mustard and inhale deeply! Lets see what its like. WHOOP!! See whed you are oder you dake your sinuses fo granded. Some of us prefer to.
17/07/92
Hows your book? I cant put it down. Gripping? You said it. Maybe you should wash your hands. Its peanut butter mixed with bubble gum.
18/07/92
Whither goest thou young rogue? Can there yet remain some villany thou hast not committed? Thou dost wrong me! Faith I know not where I wander. Methings the most capricious zephyr hath more design than I. Bot lo: do not detain me. For I am resolvd to quit this place forthwith. Ay but hear you this Ill soon know thy business get thee gone wastrel! By my troth I am off. Holy schlaMOLY isnt there a cop show on where they talk like real people? Shhh.
19/07/92
... SIGHHH... Three plus two... Calvin?
20/07/92
The best thing about Captain Steroid comic books is that every issue is number one. Every issue?? Sure! That way theyre ALL collector items! These will be worth billions of dollars some day! Of course theyre so cheaply printed you have to preserve them in plastic bags but its a small investment for such a huge guaranteed return. Gosh and I keep buying bonds. Look at the great committee that drew THIS issue!
21/07/92
Mom Hobbes takes my comic books and reads them before I do! Make him stop! Um... He spoils all the good parts too! He yells out whats happening while hes reading. He goes Oh no Captain Steroid is getting his kidneys punched with an I-Beam! Oh gross now hes bleeding all over the... Let me see this comic book. NOW DONT YOU READ IT FIRST!!
22/07/92
Mom doesnt understand comic books. She doesnt realize that comic books deal with serious issues of the day. Todays superheroes face tough moral dilemmas. Comic books arent escapist fantasy. Theyre sophisticated social critiques. Is Amazon girls super power the ability to squeeze that figure into that suit? Nah they can all do that.
23/07/92
Whoa Dad! Dont miss your bus! Leggo!
24/07/92
Is the coast clear? Give me a boost! Whats the plan? We wait for Susie to walk underneath this tree and then we drop a water balloon on her! What if she doesnt walk by? Then we just sit in the tree all day. I love summer. The days are just PACKED!
25/07/92
Wow look at the grass stains on my skin. I say if your knees arent green by the end of the day you ought to seriously re-examine your life.
26/07/92
Today at school I tried to decide whether to cheat on my test or not. I wondered is it better to do the right thing and fail... or is it better to do the wrong thing and succeed! On the one hand underserved success gives no satisfaction... but on the other hand well-deserved failure gives no satisfaction either. Of course most everybody cheats some time or other. People always bend the rules if they think they can get away with it. ...then again that doesnt justify MY cheating. Then I thought look cheating on one little test isnt such a big deal. It doesnt hurt anyone. ...but then I wondered if I was just rationalizing my unwillingness to accept the consequence of my not studying. Still in the real world people care about success not principles. ...then again maybe thats why the world is in such a mess. What a dilemma! So what did you decide? Nothing. I ran out of time and had to turn in a blank paper. Anymore simply acknowledging the issue is a moral victory. Well it just seemed wrong to cheat on an ethics test.
27/07/92
Life is so sweet.
28/07/92
I have a question Dad. Sure. Which exactly are the halcyon days of my youth? Is Saturday one? I believe they are awarded retroactively when youre grown up. You cant identify them until THEN? Calcyonity is relative. Ill go ask Mom.
29/07/92
Its too hot to sleep with you in the bed. Youre blocking the breeze and you take up too much room! Opening the window more isnt going to help! The problem is your big hot furry body! Hey! Leggo! I didnt mean it! No! Im comfortable! Reall! And Mom cant imagine how my pajamas get so gritty.
30/07/92
I dont have anything to do. Well then why dont you go clean your room? I was bragging.
31/07/92
Hows business? Terrible. Thats hard to believe. I cant understand it. Everybody I know needs what Im selling.
01/08/92
When youre as long as the pool swimming a lap in zero seconds isnt a record.
02/08/92
Look a dead bird! It mustve hit the window. Isnt it beautiful? Its so delicate. Sighhh... once its too late you appreciate what a miracle life is. You realize that nature is ruthless and our existence is very fragile temporary and precious. But to go on with your daily affairs you cant really think about that. ...which is probably why everyone takes the world for granted and why we act so thoughtlessly. Its very confusing. I suppose it will all make sense when we grow up. No doubt.
03/08/92
OPEN THE DOOR!
04/08/92
I dont have to go to bed now! I dont have to do what you say! Actually you do. Its in your contract. My contract? what contract? Oh its a pretty standard pre-natal form. I had power of attorney since you wer ejust a few cells. Paragraph two specifies your bedtime. Dad says I can renegotiate when Im 18. This 7:30 bedtime will be tough to explain to your prom date.
05/08/92
Why do you sleep so much? I like to be rested when things start to happen. What are you talking about?! Nothing ever happens around here! Give me a break! AAAUGHH!
06/08/92
Cmon lets go try to find a big poisonous snake! What will we do if we see one? Are you kidding? Well scare ourselves silly and run around in circles screaming like a bunch of loons! I look forward to when were old enough to get our morning jolt from coffee. Ahh Ill bet that wears off quicker.
07/08/92
Oh greatest of mass media thank you for elevating emotion reducing thought and stifling imagination. Thank you for the artificiality of quick solutions and for the insidious manipulation of human desires for commercial purposes. This bowl of lukewarm tapioca represents my brain. I offer it in humble sacrifice. Bestow thy flickering light forever.
08/08/92
You know what Ive discovered? What? A little rudeness and disrespect can elevate a meaningless interaction into a battle of wills and add drama to an otherwise dull day. Oh thats good to know. If you werent such a muttonhead you might have thought of it yourself! See?? You proved my point!
09/08/92
Altitude-o-tron... check! Gamma beam macerator... check! Windshield defogger... check! Initiate final countdown! Five four three two one... FWOOM. How was our day? Well I enjoyed coming home...
10/08/92
I slept on my hair funny. I can tell. Maybe if I mousse it it will stay like this! See if your Mom has any curlers for the back!
11/08/92
Hello information? Yes what exactly is the difference between a hotdog a weiner and a frankfurter? What? Whaddaya MEAN?! OK FINE! Thanks for NOTHING you fraud!! And Ive heard the operator isnt even a surgeon! You cant trust anyone.
12/08/92
Im sick of hearing about personal responsibility! Ive already DONE my part to make the world a better place to live. Really? Sure! I was BORN! Oh yes I forgot to thank you. Join the club!
13/08/92
Man it must be 100 degrees today! Animals sure are dumb to have all that fur. People sure are ugly without it. Ill bet hes cranky because hes so hot.
14/08/92
Run for your life! Theres a million angry hornets coming! Theyre insane with rage! Theyll sting anyone in their path! Lousy bugs! What are they made about? Ive been throwing rocks at their nest all morning. A REAL FRIEND WOULDNT TAKE THEIR SIDE!!
15/08/92
Whee hee hee SPLOOSHH. Oh what an awful thing I did! How I regret it now! I hereby resolve to change my evil ways! Oh remorse remorse! My penitent sinner shtick needs work.

Wake up honey. Its morning. Gosh its not very bright out. What time is ... Lets go honey. Jump out of bed! Mom?? NICE TRY!! See I TOLD you his Mom doesnt smack her lips like that. OK YOU do it next time!
18/08/92
Goodness you look tired. The monsters under my bed kept me up all night. But I checked for monsters when I tucked you in... and there werent any. I know. Then how did they get there after I left? YOU WANT ME TO CRAWL UNDER AND ASK THEM?!
19/08/92
Mom wants me to try an experiment tonight. She says the monsters under my bed may need me to THINK about them to exist. Her theory is that if I just dont think about them theyll go away. ...of course that idea of being dragged under the bed and devoured by monsters has a way of gripping the mind. And its not like Mom and Dad go away when I stop thinking about THEM.
20/08/92
Attention all monster! I am now going to stop thinking about you! MOMMMM! Admit it you LIED to us!
21/08/92
As soon as we turn the lights off the monsters will come back out from under the bed. Theyre not going to go away so I guess we need to find some way to live with them. Its hard to co-exist with things that want to kill you. Well weve got to do SOMETHING. We are. Were staying awake all night with the lights on. I wonder if we could set fire to the bed without burning the house down.
22/08/92
Whoo! It smells awful in here! Why does your room stink? Its because of the darn monsters under my bed! Calvin I dont believe for a minute that your nighttime monsters are causing this smell. But its true. See? They dont eat all the garbage we throw down there to keep em quiet.
23/08/92
AHHHHHHH. HUHHNNNGH. KAWUNCH!
24/08/92
Ta da da daaaaa! Im STUPENDOUS MAN! Kapwinnnggg! Virtual reality has nothing on Calvin.
25/08/92
I feel I have an obligation to keep a journal of my thoughts. Oh? Being a genius my ideas are naturally more important and interesting than other peoples so I figure the world would benefit from a record of my mental activities. How philanthropic of you. Well the world isnt going to get it cheap. So what are you writing today? I couldnt really think of anything so Im drawing some Martians attaching Indianapolis.
26/08/92
Call me Calvin. actually make that Calvin Boy Genius Hope of Mankind. ... or Doctor Destiny for short. (Thats Doctor Destiny Sir to you.) My journal is off to a good start.
27/08/92
I wish my shirt had a logo or a product on it. A good shirt turns the wearer into a walking corporate billboard! It says to the world My identity is so wrapped up in what I buy that I paid the COMPANY to advertise its products! Youd admit that? Oh sure endorsing products is the American way to express individuality.
28/08/92
Know what I pray for? What? The strength to change what I can the inability to accept what I cant and the incapacity to tell the difference. You should lead an interesting life. Oh I already DO!
29/08/92
Weve got to get cable TV Dad. No we dont. But people across the country are watching different TV shows than we are! If we dont all watch the same TV what will keep our culture homogeneous? We cant rely on monolithic natworks to provide uniform national blandness anymore! Theres still McDonalds and Wal-Mart. But they dont come into our HOMES!
30/08/92
DING DONG. Cmon cmon... answer the door! DING DONG DING DONG DING DONG DING DONG. Whats wrong with you people?? Dont you answer your door? AAAUGH! Oh it figures its you. Mom says our doorbell is not a toy. Go away. Hopeless. From now on its illegal to hide in other peoples houses. Good try though. Girls just dont understand sports. Thats the problem.
31/08/92
Where do the candidates stand on dinosaur research?! Thats what I want to know! Which party has the pro-paleontology platform plank? They cant ignore the dinosaur vote! If nobody panders to us well throw the election! Well stay home! Were disaffected disenfranchised and discombobulated! We single-issue activities like to have our hot buttons pushed.
01/09/92
Hey Dad know what I figured out? The meaning of words isnt a fixed thing! Any word can mean anything! By giving words new meanings ordinary English can become an exclusionary code! Two generations can be divided by the same language! To that end Ill be inventing some new definitions for common words. So well be unable to communicate. Dont you think thats totally spam? Its lubricated! Well Im phasing. Marvy. Fab. Far our.
02/09/92
Watcha doin? Im seeing if its hot enough to fry an egg on the sidewalk. I guess it isnt. Ugh. What a mess. Cmon Ill bet its hotter on the car dash!
03/09/92
I hate hearing about social responsibility! Whatever happened to unbridled greed the conspicuous consumption of wealth and the get-ahead-by-any-means credo?? Dont tell me its all over! I didnt get to participate! They cant change the game before Im old enough to play! Its not fair! The Me Decade left without its poster child. Maybe we can declare THIS the Calvin Decade.
04/09/92
I ate a popsicle and now my tongue is purple and my face is a sticky blotchy red. My fingers are gummy my arms are tacky where I wiped my mouth my shirt is dripping wet and the stick is stuck to my pocket. Im a syrupy mess! Who can I hug? Im sitting over here.
05/09/92
Oh no... oh no... WHERE ARE ALL MY CARTOON CHARACTER UNDERPANTS?? In the laundry. Wear something else. RRRRGGHHH I hate it when I cant gird my loins with funny animals.
06/09/92
Very good work Calvin. You got an A. All right class. Books open! Next chapter! Sighhhh...
07/09/92
People complain that the entertainment industry caters to the lowest common denominator of public taste but I disagree. You do? Yeah I think its a fallacy that taste bottoms out somewhere. If they could find some way to aim even LOWER theyd make some REAL money. Im sure theres a brilliant career ahead of you. There MUST be a way to cram more violence into 90 minutes!
08/09/92
Lets go! Time for bed. Im not going to bed. Oh yes you are. Move it. Dont be so dysfunctional Mom. Ive got a new entry for our list of words that get a reaction.
09/09/92
Whats with the umbrella and backpack? My motto is Be Prepared. Prepared for what? One never knows. Ive got a dart gun five comic books some gum a wrench a book on bugs a map of Montana an eraser and a rock. Gee EVERYone should carry a kit like this. The umbrella doubles as a parachute.
10/09/92
Eight hundred and seventy-three million... four hundred ninety-one thousand... six hundred and thirty-TWO! This gets easier when the numbers are big.
11/09/92
Yes Calvin? Miss Wormwood Im a fierce advocate of the separation of church and state. Nevertheless I feel the need for spiritual guidance and comfort as I face the days struggles. So I was wondering if I could strip down smear myself with paste and set fire to this little effigy of you in a non-denominational sort of way. Boy what a touchy subject!
12/09/92
I DONT WANNA TAKE A BATH! I DONT WANNA TAKE A BATH! YOU CANT MAKE ME! AGHH! LEGGO! LEGGO! NO NO NO NO NO NO NO! PUT ME DOWN! I WISH I WAS DEAD! I HATE YOU ALL! I HATE EVERYTHING! AARRGGHHH! Whenever I hear about people trying to rediscover the child within I want to scream.
13/09/92
Calvin the mighty tyrannosaur stands over his kill and roars triumphantly! The struggle to bring down his prey has given Calvin a monstrous appetite! With massive jaws twisting violently at the carcass he rips apart gigantic chunks and swallows them whole! What a disgusting spectacle of savage gluttony! Thats enough for tonight Calvin. Youre going to get sick if you eat all that. But Mom I earned it!
14/09/92
When you look at me its clear that my genes contain the evolutionary perfection of earthly DNA. I am the culmination of creation. With no tail?! I dont think so! Stop that! My butt doesnt NEED aesthetic enhancement.
15/09/92
When you think how well basic appliances work its hard to believe anyone ever gets on an airplane.
16/09/92
Here take a picture of me OK? Sure. Ill sit holding this big book looking contemplative. Why do you want a picture like THAT? On the off-chance I decide to do something responsible with my life Ill need to establish a ficticious childhood.
17/09/92
This is what I like about photography. People think cameras always tell the truth. They think the camera is a dispassionate machine that records only facts but really cameras lie all the time! Select the facts and you manipulate the truth! For example Ive cleared off this corner of my bed. Take a picture of me here but crop out all the mess around me so it looks like I keep my room tidy. Is this even legal? Wait let me comb my hair and put on a tie.
18/09/92
OK theres a picture of me looking well-adjusted and playing sports. That ought to do it. You hate sports. Yeah but people believe what they see and now weve got a photographic document of a fake childhood ready for any future biographical needs I may have! Pretty shrewd planning huh? Except for one detail. Suppose the photographer doesnt keep quiet? You drive a hard bargain flea-bait. Ooh now Maggot-man is about to reveal his secret identity to Amazon-babe!
19/09/92
Im a simple man Hobbes. YOU?? Yesterday you wanted a nuclear powered car that could turn into a jet with laser-guided head-seeking missiles! Im a simple man with complex tastes.
20/09/92
If you could have anything in the world right now what would it be? ...hmm... Anything at all! Whatever you want! A sandwich. A SANDWICH?!? WHAT KIND OF A STUPID WISH IS THAT?! Talk about a failure of imagination! ID ask for a trillion billion dollars my own space shuttle and a private continent. I got MY wish.
21/09/92
You have a question Calvin? More of a statement really. I just want to say that education is our most important investment in the future and its scandalous how little our educators are paid! OK hands up. Who ELSE didnt do the homework for today? Actually Id like to see more teachers out on the streets.
22/09/92
Youre dead at recess Twinky. You dont scare ME Moe. This is just your clumsy way of coping with the fact that IM a genius and YOURE still struggling with the concept of walking erect. POW! The truth will set your teeth free.
23/09/92
I hate school! Im not going to school ever again! I refuse! I think Mum lettered in shot put her junior year.
24/09/92
I hate going to school. I wish I was a tiger. Tigers dont need to know anything. Attacking running animals involves a lot of physics. Theres velocity gravity and laws of motion not to mention all the biology we have to know. Then theres the artistic expression of it all and a lot more! Gosh I never realized killing was so grounded in the liberal arts. My dissertation on ethics was VERY well received.
25/09/92
I figured out how I can achieve success without hard work. How? Ill find a profession where everyone in it is worse than me! That might take hard work.
26/09/92
Act casual.
27/09/92
BBRRBBBRBB beep beep. GAAAPA! OOMP. You moved upwind silly! Sheesh human senses arent worth beans. GET OFF ME YOU PSYCHOTIC SAVAGE! Your nature program is on. Dont you want to watch it? NO!
28/09/92
Arent you supposed to be doing your homework? Im pretty sure the assignment was optional. Denial springs eternal. Its not denial. Im just very selective about the reality I accept.
29/09/92
I say a day without denial is a day youve got to face. From now on Im not going to think about anything unpleasant. Isnt that a self-deceiving way to go through life? Im not going to think about that.
30/09/92
Time for your bath. Lets go. Sorry Im in denial about my baths. Fine. Go ahead and deny it. Nobody respects my denial.

Can I have five dollars? If you want money you should earn it by working. Shaking you down seems to be work.
03/10/92
I need a push! Someone push me! I need a push! Everybody I know fails the acid test of friendship.
04/10/92
Boy its cold out! Its a perfect day for us snowmen! What a great spot for a few feet of snow! Yes sir. A snowman like me could be real happy here! ... sighhhh... The decoy isnt working? Maybe ducks are easier to fool than snow.
05/10/92
A quandary. Mom once said she loved me just the way I am. So I wonder what would happen if I became a clam. If her son was gray and grimy slippery and sliy an oversized hors doeuvre would Mom still have the nerve? Good poetry gives me goosebumps.
06/10/92
What story would you like tonight? We can read anything except... Hamster Huey and the Gooey Kablooie! NO! No Hamster Huey tonight! Weve read that book a million times! I want Hamster Huey! Look you KNOW how the story goes! Youve memorized the whole thing! Its the same story every day! I WANT HAMSTER HUEY! Wow the story was different THAT time! Do you think the townsfolk will ever find Hamster Hueys head?
07/10/92
I wish I had a baby brother. You want a new friend to play with? No I want somebody small I could beat up. Look honey can we talk about that operation some other time?
08/10/92
Dad? are you busy? Well sort of why? Oh nothing. I was just thinking maybe if you had the time you and I could do a father-son kind of project. You know just the two of us. Why of course we can! Thats more important than this! Sure what would you like to do? Youre old enough to buy firearms and explosives right?
09/10/92
Look how your tail flips around! I wonder which muscles control that. I can sort of clench my butt but I dont think it could wiggle a tail. Hmm how strange! Ive never really thought about butt muscles before. Some things dont need the thought people give them.
10/10/92
IM IN A VERY BAD MOOD SO NOBODYD BETTER MESS WITH ME TODAY BOY!! Here I got you a new comic book. Why dont you just sit on the couch and Ill make you some peanut butter crackers. Are you comfy? Um I guess so. Mom knows EVERYTHING.
11/10/92
Hello Calvin. I am Doctor 5-40. Y-youre a robot?? Ha hah affirmative. We wouldnt trust a delicate operation like this to clumsy HUMAN hands now would we? Um... I gues not... Hows the anesthetic? Feel anything? ... no... Good. This will just take a moment. Hold this jar would you? Ta de tum tum... a little gray matter here a dab there... ah that should do it. Wow that was easy! How do you fell? Smart! This knowledge implant should provide all the wisdom youll ever need. Great! No more school! Thanks Doctor! Go home and have 12 years of fun. Sighhhh.
12/10/92
I bet youre all thinking Wow how did these clothes walk to the front of the class all by themselves? And NOW look! Heres a piece of chalk floating around! Pretty weird huh? Yes for Show and Tell today I Calvin have turned myself invisible! Ha ha! Now Ill take off these clothes and the next sound you hear will be my feet heading for the door! Adios amigos! Lucky guess Miss Wormwood! Woooooh these pants are hovering over the class! Ooooh!
13/10/92
Im not going to do my math homework. Look at these unsolved problems. Heres a number in mortal combat with another. One of them is going to get subtracted. But why? How? What will be left of him? If I answered these it would kill the suspense. It would resolve the conflict and turn intruiging possibilities into boring ol facts. I never really thought about the literary qualities of math. I prefer to savor the myster.
14/10/92
Miss Wormwood? Yes Calvin? If ignorance is bliss this lesson would appear to be a deliberate attempt to deprive me of happiness the pursuit of which is my unalienable right according to the declaration of independence. I therefore assert my patriotic prerogative not to know this material. Ill be out on the playground. HELLLPP! MONARCHISTS!
15/10/92
Im gonna pound you at recess Twinky. Oh yeah? ID LIKE TO SEE YOU TRY IT! My brain wishes my ego had call-waiting.
16/10/92
Hello county library? Yes do you have any books on why girls are so weird? Thats what I said. Or you might also try looking under obnoxious. Are you serious?! You mean theres no research on this at all?? Ill bet the library just doesnt want anyone to know.
17/10/92
MOM? MOM? Im taking a bath Calvin. Oh OK never mind. It was nothing. SPLISH SPLASH SPLOOSH. Its ALWAYS something. So Ive noticed.
18/10/92
Look at that kids snowman! What a pathetic cliche! Am I supposed to identify with this complacent moron and his shovel?? This snowman says nothing about the human condition! Is this all the kid has to say about contemporary suburban life?! The soulless banality of this snowman is a sad comment on todays art world. Now come look at MY snowman. I call it The Torment of Existence Weighted Against the Horror of Nonbeing. As he melts this sculpture will become even more poignant. I admire your willingness to put artistic integrity before marketability.
19/10/92
BARK BARK BARK WOOF WOOF Oh no not AGAIN! Once this starts every dog in the neighborhood starts yapping! GET IN HERE!
20/10/92
I wish it was winter. Well it wont be for a while yet. Then I wish it was spring or summer. You dont like autumn? Oh autumn is fine. Its the present I dont like.
21/10/92
There really ought to be a fall olympics.
22/10/92
Its a high price to pay but nuzzling tiger tummies is one of the great pleasures of life.
23/10/92
I said to go out LONG! Keep going! This is as far as you can throw the ball. THATS NOT TRUE! OK Ill step closer. Itll be the last think you ever do you flea feast? Oh yeah? Lets see if you fight as badly as you throw! I guess this is another incomplete. Its a good thing we dont have to fight some OTHER team!
24/10/92
Wheres the ball? I dont see it. You look over there and Ill look over here. It doesnt matter if you win or lose. Its HOW you play the game!
25/10/92
Thats two outs! I shouldve stayed at second base. Youve still got a snowman at third. I love a good game of speed sled base snow ball!
26/10/92
I love recess! Two minutes ago I was eating devilled ham chocolate milk grapes and ice cream. And now Im running around on a playground full of nausea-inducing disorienting motion devices. Its the one time at school I get some solitude.
27/10/92
Hey Susie pick a number in the fortune teller. Um... three. One two three! Now pick a letter. B. We lift up flap B and it says Youre a mouth-breakthing bag of boogers! AH HA HA HA HA HA! Life doesnt get much better than this.
28/10/92
RRINNGGG. Didnt you hear the bell? Recess is over. Its time to go in. Im not done yet. It takes me more than one recess to wear myself into a state of submission.
29/10/92
Susie do you want to trade Captain Napalm bubble gum cards? After chewing almost $20 worth of gum Ive collected all the cards except numbers 8 and 34. Ill trade you any duplicate for either of those. I dont collect Captain Napalm bubble gum cards. It must be depressing to go through life with no purpose.
30/10/92
OOF! Ackpth! Pbthp! That was a fumble! Arent you going to get the ball? No you can have it. Its not much fun playing with someone who would rather tackle than win. Go on take a running start.
31/10/92
Its third down and four to go...
01/11/92
My hands were all shaky my face had gone pale. A letter from Santa just arrived in the mail! It was hand-written in old-fashioned ink pen. It was handsomely printed and dated twelve ten. Dear Calvin it said Im writing because this year Ive repealed my naught / nice laws. So now I urge you: be vulgar and crude! I LIKE it when children are boorish and rude! Burp at the table! Gargle your peas! Never say Thank you Youre welcome or Please. Talk back to your mother. Do as youre told. Stick your tongue out at your Dad if he scolds! Drive everyone crazy I really dont care! Act like a jerk anytime anywhere! Im changing the rules! The BAD girld and boys will be from now on the ones who get the toys! Good little kids make me sick its no joke. Sincerely signed Santa. ... and then I awoke. I hate being good (or trying to fake it). Six days until Christmas! I dont think Ill make it.
02/11/92
Here Calvin you got a letter in the mail. I did?? Gosh I never get mail! I wonder who sent this. Theres no return address! In its place theres a crude human skull with Xs for eyes and its tongue hanging out. Maybe its the IRS.
03/11/92
Look Hobbes I got a mysterious letter! The return address is a skull with X-ed out eyes! It has a local postmark though. So I must know the person. Oh boy intrigue! But who would send me an anonymous weird letter like this? Maybe a GIRL! GAAAA! Doesnt the post office SCREEN anything? Ill get you some gloves!
04/11/92
If this is from a girl well have to bury it real deep and disinfect my room. Hurry! Open it! Ugh what if its some mushy poem written with a pink pen in loopy letters with the Is dotted with hearts?? I think Id puke. No its cut and pasted letters from a magazine! Wow! No handwriting to trace! It says Coded message to follow. A-1 B-2 etc. Destroy this letter. Hobbes were dealing with a PRO!
05/11/92
Can you believe this?? A skull for a return addres untraceable cut-out letters and a code key for a future message. This is real secret agent stuff! Whoever sent this is taking no chances on the message being traced or intercepted! Gosh the message must be super top secret and important! I wonder what it could be! I wonder when Ill find out. Its a good thing youre the patient type. This is so cool I have to go to the bathroom!
06/11/92
This is so exciting to get a secret untraceable message in the mail! It said a coded letter would follow! Maybe it will arrive today! I cant wait to get home and see! I wonder what it will say? I wonder who sent it? I wonder why its in code? Ill bet I grow up to be a spy! Im so good at figuring out whats going on!
07/11/92
Im home! Im home! Did I get a letter today?? Yes its on the table. Oh boy Hobbes this is it! This is the coded message! Quick lets decipher it! OK the first number is 3 so that would be C. Next is 1. So thats A. This is fun! Hey! This says Calvin is a porridge brain! Its... its an INSULT! Some people have secret admirers. YOU have a secret detractor!
08/11/92
We got some new snow last night! Lets look for animal tracks! Here are some bird tracks. Look you can see wing impressions where they took off! And these are rabbit tracks. Looks like they were going pretty fast. No wonder! Look at THESE tracks! Something was chasing them all over the place! Hmm... big pads... could be a wolf. But there are no clan impressions. Its more like a bobcat or a mountain lion or... or... This explains the cold wet feet in my bed this morning. The snow was falling and I thought The birds and the rabbits around here need some exercise.
09/11/92
Ooh this burns me up! A coded message saying Calvin is a porridge brain! The nerve! The bizarre skull drawing the cut and pasted letters the code... all that suspense and mystery for an insult! What kind of depraved maniac would go to so much trouble?! Rrrghhh I wish I knew who sent this!! Our only clue is that the twisted fiend has too much time on his hands. Another letter for you Calvin! How nice to get so much mail.
10/11/92
Look Hobbes the skull! Its another letter from the secret insulter! More cut and pasted letters! It says You look like a baboon and you smell like one too! Ha ha. The mystery deepens. WHO COULD BE SENDING THESE?! A reckless exaggerator. You dont LOOK like a baboon. OH YOURE A BIG HELP!
11/11/92
I cant sleep. Whos been sending me these insults? Where will it stop?! Am I going to get an insult in the mail every day for the rest of my life?? The thing that drives me crazy is that theres no way to trace this lunatic! Hes thought of everything! Hes a mastermind! Hey who cut up this magazine?
12/11/92
Did I get another letter today? Yep! When you write to yourself you get a lot of mail. I dont write these! What are you talking about? Oh cmon Calvin. I know youve been putting these out for the mailman every day. Wait a minute! These are coming from OUR house?? Oh and I want you to ASK before you cut up my magazines OK? ALL RIGHT WHERES THAT MISERABLE BUNCH OF STRIPEY ORANGE FLEA BAIT?!?
13/11/92
So it was YOU the whole time! YOURE the one whos been sending me insults in the mail!! Ill get you for this! You and your sneaky codes and pasted letters and skull drawings! ... although really the skull drawings were pretty cool. You can tell a good spy by his ominous logo.
14/11/92
You and I are through! Ill teach you to trick me you big hairball! You just have no sense of humor! I do too! Its just that was a terrible nasty awful thing to do and Ill never forgiv... huh? Heyyyy youre right! It IS funny! Ha ha ha! ... OK! Were pals again! SUSIE: you smell! Ha ha!
15/11/92
AAAAUGHH! Is the water too cold? Um... no its fine. Then stop that infernal screaming. Yes Mom.
16/11/92
... meeting smile after sa-mi-i-ile in the air theres a fee-heeling of christmassss. NOT THINKING ABOUT IT WONT MAKE IT GO AWAY YOU KNOW!
17/11/92
Look Hobbes I got a paint by numbers kit! Its really fun. But youre not painting in the lines and not using the colors that correspond to the numbers. If I did THAT Id get the picture they show on the box! Ah.
18/11/92
Well your haircut is a big improvement. You LIKE what it says on the back of my head? What WHAT says? Didnt the barber shave I may have a bad haricut but youre downright ugly back there? Good heavens no! OK CHARLIE GIMME BACK THAT TIP!
19/11/92
These fall mornings sure are pretty. The brisk air the smell of leaves... all ruined because I have to get on a bus and go to school. When I was a pre-schooler I never took advantage of fall mornings. I didnt appreciate them. Another squandered youth. Sighhh... I was so young and foolish. I thought those days would last forever.
20/11/92
Hello? ... No my Mom cant come to the phone right now. Sure Ill be glad to take a message. You write it down drive it over here pay me five bucks and Ill give it to her the next time I see her. He must not have wanted to talk to Mom very bad.
21/11/92
Im growing my fingernails long. Then Ill file them into points so Ill have claws just like you. Mine are retractable. No retractable claws no opposable toes no prehensile tail no compound eyes no fangs no wings... SIGHHH...
22/11/92
How unoriginal! How hehune! Stupid kid. If you dont have anything to say just keep quiet! Well this is certainly shocking! Face it kid provoking a reaction isnt the same thing as saying something significant! Look pal theres no point expressing ideas if you cant make them understood! Youre just babbling to yourself! And arent we all bored with the irony byy now?You just THINK youre above it all kid! I tell you Hobbes its tough being the sole guardian of high culture. Talent like ours carries such enormous responsibility.
23/11/92
Can I learn to parachute out of an airplane? Why dont you just play chicken on the railroad tracks? It would be a cheaper way to toy with death Im sure. Moms so practical.
24/11/92
This connect-the-dots book really makes me mad! Look at this. Its a duck. I know! Who wants to draw a duck?! I sure didnt! They MADE me! Ive been maninpualted! My natural artistic talent has been used against my will to create some coprorate entitys crude idea of waterfowl! Its outrageous! Another blow to creative integrity. From now on Ill connect the dots my OWN way.
25/11/92
Miss Wormwood my Dad says when he was in school they taught him to do math on a slide rule. He says he hasnt used a slide rule since because he got a five-buck calculator that can do more functions than he could figure out if his life depended on it. Given the pace of technology I propose we leave math to the machines and go play outside. My bills always die in the subcommittee.
26/11/92
How do bank machines work Dad? Well lets say you wwant 25 dollars. You punch in the amount... and behind the machine theres a guy with a printing press who makes the money and sticks it out this slot. Sort of like the huy who lives up in our garage and opens the door? Exactly.
27/11/92
Miss Wormwood? Yes Calvin? You can present the material but you cant make me care. Rumor has it shes up to two packs a day unfiltered.
28/11/92
Ive noticed that comic book superheroes usually fight evil maniacs with grandiose plans to destroy the world. Why dont superheroes go after the more subtle realistic bad guys? Yeah the superhero coiuld attend council meetings and write letters to the editor and stuff. Hmm... I think I see the problem. Quick! To the bat fax!
29/11/92
UHNGGG. Its the late jurassic. Calvin the awful allosaur darts around a giant unsuspecting diplodocus! Calvin crouches in his hiding place muscles tensed for the surprise attach! He waits... he waits! AAAAAAAA Sheesh whats wrong with taking a little break?!

For Show and Tell today I dont have anything to show. But Ill TELL you that when Im at school my Mom puts on a patriotic leotard a cape and knee-high high-heeled boots and she fights crime as a super-heroine. I hope youre duly impressed. Thank you very much. Thats the note his teacher sent home with him. Wow show me that outfit sometime.

Do you hate being a girl? Its gotta be better than the alternative. Whats it like? Is it like being a bug? Like a WHAT?! I imagine bugs and girls have a dim perception that nature played a cruel trick on them but they lack the intelligence to really comprehend the magnitude of it. I mustve put my finger on it.
03/12/92
Im home! Im free! The rest of the day is all mine! Finally some time to myself! Liberty precious liberty! Ha ha ha!
04/12/92
Dad are you vicariously living through me in the hope that my accomplishments will validate your mediocre life and in some way compensate for all the opportunities you botched? If I were you can bet Id be re-evaluating my strategy. Mom Dad keeps insulting me.
05/12/92
I like rocks. Heres a nice one. See how smoothit is? It probably took eons to get like that. Its a sedimentary rock formed by sediment deposits as opposed to say an igneous rock which is volcanic in origin. You sure know a lot about rocks. You bet. Ballistic missiles from God I call em.
06/12/92
Im going to paste Susie with a slushball! Heh heh heh! Some philosophers say that TRUE happiness comes from a life of virtue! Someday Ill write my OWN philosophy book. Virtue needs some cheaper thrills.
07/12/92
Wake up get up... Shut up listen up... Throw up... Mix up goof up... Hurry up... Hows your day? Looking up.
08/12/92
Dear Santa This year I dont want any gifts. I just want love and peace for my fellow man. Reverse psychology. Kind of risky dont you think?
09/12/92
Dear Santa Why is your operation in the North Pole? Im guessing cheap elf labor lower environmental standards and tax breaks. Is this really the example you want to set for us impressionable kids? My plan is to put him on the defensive before he considers how good Ive been.
10/12/92
Dear Santa Last year I asked for a long-range thermo-nuclear Smart missile and a launcher. Instead I got socks and a shirt. Obviously you mixed up my order with someone elses. Lets get with the program huh? Just because he gives the stuff away free he thinks he can get away with an incompetent organization.
11/12/92
Look at this great snowball! Id sure like to paste someone upside the head with it. ... but I figure each snowball I throw means Ill get one less present from Santa. I wish I knew if Santa was bringing me any underwear.
12/12/92
Ski resorts use man-made snow. They have snow-making machines that can cover a whole hillsie. Hint hint. You can rely on the weather like every other kid.
13/12/92
You got something in the mail. It looks like a Valentine card. Huh? Open it up! It IS a valentine! Who would send me a valentine? Read it! Read it! Roses are rd violets are blue tu-lips are what well be kissing woo woo! Love Susie. AAAUGGHH! Ho HO! Muchas smooches for el conKISStador! This cant be happening! Its all a nightmare! Some horrible hallucination! Susie loves Calvin! Calvin loves Susie! Ive got to pull myself together! What can I DO? My natural studliness has overwhelmed Susies fragile grip on reality! Big sloppy smackers! Smmmrppp! Hey theres Susie now! Shes coming this way! Oh NO! Quick! A slushball! I need a slushball! Hi Cal... OOMP!! THATS what I think of your mushy Valentine card! POW! I didnt send you a Valentine card you smelly snot-nosed troll! Why on earth would I send a valentine to YOU?? You didnt? But... but... Im telling! ... then who...?? Matchmaker matchmaker make me a match... YOU!! You write that card! You tricked me!! Wheeeeee! Love makes the world go round! Youre gonna see STARS go round I promise!
14/12/92
Oh look yet another Christmas TV special! How touching to have the meaning of Christmas brought to us by cola fast food and beer conglomerates. Whod have ever guessed product consumption popular entertainment and spirituality would mix so harmoniously. Its a beautiful world all right. Dad doesnt handle the seasons stress very gracefully.
15/12/92
Dad Id like to have a little talk. Um OK... As the wage earner here its your responsibiliy to show some consumer confidence and start buying things that will get the economy going and create profits and employment. Heres a list of big-ticket items Id like for Christmas. I hope I can trust you to do whats right for our country. Ive got to stop leaving the Wall Street Journal around.
16/12/92
RRRRGGHHH. I say if a novelty Christmas song is funny the first time its funny EVERY time.
17/12/92
Im having a lot of holiday stress. Why? You dont shop for anyone youve got two weeks off from school and your parents do all the cooking cleaning and decorating! How could you have holiday stress? Deep down I doubt my greed for presents can overcome my desire to misbehave.
18/12/92
OK Hobbes Ive got a plan. Yeah? If I do ten spontaneous acts of good will a day from now until Christmas Santa will have to be lenient in judging the rest of this last year! I can claim Ive turned a new leaf! Ten spontaneous acts of good will a day? Thats pretty many. Dont remind me. Well heres your chance. Susies coming this way. Maybe Ill start tomorrow and do 20 a day.
19/12/92
Oh man Susies right in range! Its a clear shot! I cant miss! I thought you were going to do ten spontaneous acts of good will a day. Its not even noon. Ill do em after lunch. Look doing ten good acts isnt going to impress Santa if you do BAD things all morning! Suppose I just graze her jaw and knock some fillings loose. That would be in the gray area dont you think? Dont expect to play with all MY presents when you dont get any.
20/12/92
My hands were all shaky my face had gone pale. A letter from Santa just arrived in the mail! It was hand-written in old-fashioned ink pen. It was handsomely printed and dated twelve ten. Dear Calvin it said Im writing because this year Ive repealed my naught / nice laws. So now I urge you: be vulgar and crude! I LIKE it when children are boorish and rude! Burp at the table! Gargle your peas! Never say Thank you Youre welcome or Please. Talk back to your mother. Do as youre told. Stick your tongue out at your Dad if he scolds! Drive everyone crazy I really dont care! Act like a jerk anytime anywhere! Im changing the rules! The BAD girld and boys will be from now on the ones who get the toys! Good little kids make me sick its no joke. Sincerely signed Santa. ... and then I awoke. I hate being good (or trying to fake it). Six days until Christmas! I dont think Ill make it.
21/12/92
SMACK YES! IM SORRY! Not as sorry as youre GOING to be! I think as long as you SUFFER for your sins they dont count. Its your only hope.
22/12/92
Here! Its a comic book! Its MY comic book. But you can read it. Just make sure your hands are clean and acid-free and only touch the mylar bag and use these sterilized tongs to turn the pages and try not to exhale too much moisture OK?! Dont mess it up! THERE! Thats one spontaneous act of good will! I hope youre satisfied. Santa! Darn you!! I think spontaneous acts of good will should be less reluctant. RELUCTANT ONES QUALIFY!!
23/12/92
Mush hullp smack ullkk... Mom Im guessing this is boiled guano on raw maggots but Im (orrg) choling it down as best as my cramping stomach allows. This is another spontaneous act of good will Santa! Youd better come through in SPADES for this!! More maggots? SURE! PILE EM ON!
24/12/92
One more day of being good! This has been the longest week of my entire life. HEY! Ill bet Santas loading up the sleigh right now! Hes got millions of deliveries right? He couldnt possible still be deciding how good I am! If his decision is made I dont have to impress him any more! Im free! The charade is over! I can do what I want! Maybe hes loading your stuff last just to see what you do. You think? Well maybe. Geez hes a tough ol geezer! Well whats one more day? ...sigh...
25/12/92
Its a certificate entitling the bearer to one day pounce-free of tiger attacks! Wow! Thanks ol buddy! You always think of the best gifts! I still think this couldve waited until sunrise. Shh take a picture.
26/12/92
The snow isnt deep enough for sledding. And its not wet enough to pack either. Sighhhh. Fortunately Im the stoic type. Youre an inspiration to us all.
27/12/92
Are you making any resolutions for the new year? Nope! I want everything to stay the same as it was this year. Everything? Right. This year was lousy but at least its familiar. I hate change! Its too disruptive! When things are difference you have to think about the change and deal with it! I like things to stay the same so I can take everything for granted! Besides things keep changing for the WORSE! The longer I live the more complicated everything gets! I say lets stop here before life gets any harder! From now on no more change! Im bored. Lets do something different. SOME things dont change.
28/12/92
You know its amazing how many things can be taken apart with just one ordinary screwdriver! Such as? Well just for starters theres... that is hypothetically I mean... not that Id know for a fact of course... just in theory I imagine that maybe... um well gosh its hard to say. Ive GOT to stop introducing topics of conversation.
29/12/92
You know what the problem is with the universe? Um... Theres no toll-free customer service hot line for complaints! Thats why things dont get fixed! If the universe had any decent management wed get a full refund if we werent completely satisfied! But the place is free! See thats another thing. They should have a cover charge and keep out the riffraff.
30/12/92
Do you need nails pounded into anything? Name the surface and Ill fill it full of nails! Um no... You sure? Ive got the tools right here! Lots of nail sizes! Id be happy to do it! No thanks not today. OK well let me know when you cange your mind. Mm-hmm. Mom wanted a girl. I just know it. Did she want anything sawed?
31/12/92
People always seem so crabby and animals always seem so content. I wonder why that is. Its probably because animals know theyre superior and people know theyre inferior. I figured it was because animals get 15 hours of sleep every day. Actually I think animals are just as crabby as people are.
01/01/93
Wow look at the snow coming down! The roads are a mess! I hope Dad makes it home OK. Face it Dad. The seasons over. Are you kidding? In this stuff I reach my optimal heart rate in no time!
02/01/93
Ive decided to stop caring about things. If you care you just get disappointed all the time. If you DONT care nothing matters so youre never upset. From now on my rallying cry is SO WHAT?! Thats a tough cry to rally around. So what?!
03/01/93
YA-A! WHOK. UHN-GG. There were two ways to resolve our differences. I ruled out a thoughtful discussion. Foolish Amazon! I am only toying with you! YEAH?? Well toy with THIS!! The hyper-phase distortion blaster? I could feel my spine shatter. It hurt... BUDDOW. ...a lot. Next ISH --- Injuries to go ...hehh hah hooh... hahh heh hmh Click. No you dont. Theres too much violence on TV. Why dont you go read something?
04/01/93
Im not getting up until its as warm out there as it is in here.
05/01/93
I dont want to go to school. I dont want to know anything new. I already know more than I want to! I liked things better when I didnt understand them! The fact is Im being educated against my will! My rights are being trampled! Is it a right to remain ignorant? I dont know but I refuse to find out!
06/01/93
It would sure be a big surprise if the school bus spontaneously exploded and I didnt have to go to school! Yeah Id sure be surprised if THAT happened! Life is full of surprises but never when you need one.
07/01/93
IM HO-OME! Hello?? Thanks for the big welcome! Youre letting in cold air.
08/01/93
Problems often look overwhelming at first. The secret is to break problems into small manageable chunks. If you deal with THOSE youre done before you know it. For example Im supposed to read this entire history chapter. It looks impossible so I break the problem down. You focus on reading the first section? I ask myself Do I even care?
09/01/93
Watcha doin? Im killing time while I wait for life to shower me with meaning and happiness. I hope youre comfy. You could get me something to eat.
10/01/93
IM HO-OME! Click. OOMF! SEE? SEE?! Thats what he does when I come home!! He thinks YOU tossed ME in the air?! Why Ive never been so insulted in my life! I need to get a video camera.
11/01/93
This snowman doesnt look very happy. Hes not. He knows its just a matter of time before he melts. The sun ignores his entreaties. He feels his existence is meaningless. Is it? Nope. Hes about to buy a big screen TV.
12/01/93
Home sweet home.
13/01/93
For the townsfolk below the day began like any other day.
14/01/93
Whats wrong with your snowman? Its a snow WOMAN. I dont care. Were not having an anatomically correct snowman in the front yard.
15/01/93
I hate trudging up these hills. I didnt come out here to WORK! I came out here to ride and have FUN! Well you cant ride the sled if you dont climb the hills. I could if you pulled me up. Hes so lazy and selfish.
16/01/93
Ha ha! Id sure like to see Mom make me come inside NOW! With this fort and arsenal of 200 snowballs NOBODY can tell ME what to do! I can stay out here all day! At last Im the master of my fate! Ill stay outside as long as I please! Back inside so soon? Its too cold out.
17/01/93
Blecchhh. TO BE?? ...or... NOT to be? *sighhh* That is the question. Whether tis nobler in the mind to SUFFER the SLIGNS and ARROWS of outrageous fortune... ...or to take ARMS against a sea of troubles... and by opposing END them? To die: to sleep: no more! And by a sleep to say we END the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to... *sniff* tis a consummation devoutly to be wished! To die to sleep! To sleep perchance to DREAM: Ay THERES the rub! ... for in that sleep of death what dreams may come when we have shuffled off this mortal coil must give us pause. Blink blink. FEEHEELINGGS wo wo wo. You finished that right up! Did you like it? Lets not have this ever again.
18/01/93
Eggplant Casserole tonight? Why yes!
19/01/93
All that fur must be strictly ornamental.
20/01/93
NICE TRYYY!
21/01/93
Nothing I do is my fault. My family is dysfunctional and my parents wont empower me! Consequently Im not self-actualized! My behaviour is addictive functioning in a disease process of codependency! I need holistic healing and wellness before I accept any responsibility for my actions! One of us needs to stick his head in a bucket of ice water. I love the culture of victimhood.
22/01/93
Why is this snowman looking at a snowball? Hes contemplating snowman evolution. Obviously if he evolved from a snowball it raises tough theological questions for him. Like the morality of throwing someones precursors at someone? Sure. And what about shoveling ones genetic material off the walk?
23/01/93
Its that moment of dawning comprehension I live for.
24/01/93
Look at this! Some idiot dumped trash out here! People seem to forget that others of us have to live on this planet too. You know I dont understand why humans evolved as such thoughtless shortsighted creatures. Well it cant stay that way forever. You think well get smarter. Thats one of the two possibilities. Maybe well stop polluting before its too late. Were all holding our breath.
25/01/93
I like to verb words. What? I take nouns and adjectives and use them as verbs. Remember when access was a thing? Now its something you DO. It got verbed. Verbing weirds language. Maybe we can eventually make language a complete impediment to understanding.
26/01/93
Wow chocolate chip cookie batter! I love it before its cooked! Can I have some? Please please? Now its got raw eggs in it and you could get salmonella poisoning. One more nostalgic part of childhood goes THBPPTH.
27/01/93
Where are my glasses? I thought they were right here. Hmm... I put them down... I went to get my book... I told Calvin to shovel the walk... Where could they be??
28/01/93
The secret to making great hot chocolate is to put the tiny marshmallows in FIRST. So they melt faster? No. So you can fit in 40 or 50 of them. This way the hot chocolate just fills the cracks. I wondered why you eat it with a fork. Also I dont use milk. I just heat the syrup.
29/01/93
What are you doing? Dont wear your boots through the house! Considering where my SHOES have been I thought shed be happy.
30/01/93
If you do a job badly enough sometimes you dont get asked to do it again.
31/01/93
Any good mail today? Mm... not really. Heres a Youre not covering the cost of all these mailings charity request. Youve got a Youre not attractive enough womens magazine with an article on swimsuits that minimize all your body flaws. Here are some Youre not stylish or ostentatious enough catalogs... and coincidentally an invitation to go deeper in debt from a credit card company. And heres our news magazine to identify the trend of the week were missing... and I got a hobby magazine featuring new equipment I ought to have. Yikes. ...Why do I get the feeling that society is trying to make us discontented with everything we do and insecure about who we are? I suppose if people thought about real issues and needs instead of manufactured desires the economy would collaps and wed have total anarchy. So pitching this junk would make me some kind of terrorist huh? Yep. Its our patriotic duty to buy distractions from a simple life. Hey Mom I saw a bunch of products on TV that I didnt know existed but I desperately need!
01/02/93
1. Write a paragraph explaining the significance of Magellans expedition. A gas mask a smoke grenade and a helicopter... thats all I ask.
02/02/93
Calvin dont just throw your wet coat on the floor! Hang it up where it belongs! Im not looking for extra work around here. Oh like I am.
03/02/93
Im gonna pound you at recess Twinky. Oh yeah? Well youll have to catch me first! When your strategy is to run like a squirrel its hard to come up with a good taunt.
04/02/93
Today for Show and Tell Ive brought a tiny marvel of nature: a single snowflake. I think we might all learn a lesson from how this utterly unique and exquisite crystal... turns into an ordinary boring molecule of water just like every other one when you bring it in the classroom. And now while the analogy sinks in Ill be leaving you drips and going outside. CALVIN!
05/02/93
Look at this sandwich my Mom made! Im not eating this wretched thing! Why this squid isnt even fresh! Smell it! Look how rubbery it is! And the inky brine has soaked the bread! The pickles are pulp! Gross! Wanna trade! Nobody will trade with a kid whose Mom makes a bad sandwich.
06/02/93
You know what astronauts can do right in their spacesuits? Geez how am I ever going to learn to be an astronaut?
07/02/93
Stranded on a distant planet the fearless Spaceman Spiff has been captured by a horrible Yukbarf! So the earthling villain wont cooperate eh? Well see about that! Take him to the dungeon! Yes your most supreme odoriferousness! You dont scare ME you talking blobs of oozing slop! I am impervious to pain! Hey what kind of dungeon is this?! Arent you going to torture me? Oh yes! Have a seat and lets see how you withstand a calm discussion of wholesome principles! AAAUGH. Yes. life is tough and suffering builds character. Nothing worth having ever comes easy. Virtue is its own reward and when I was your age...
08/02/93
Oh lovely snowball packed with care smack a head thats unaware! Then with freezing ice to spare melt and soak through underwear! Fly straight and true hit hard and square! This oh snowball is my prayer. I only throw consecrated snowballs.
09/02/93
What are you doing? Im throwing people off my trail with deceptive footprints. See everyone will think these tracks were made by a one-legged kid going THAT way and theyll be completely wrong! Who exactly is on your trail? Look it doesnt hurt to take precautions.
10/02/93
Nobody can make me go inside! Ive got 200 snowballs that say Im staying OUT! No ones gonna make ME come in the house! DOESNT ANYBODY MISS ME?!?
11/02/93
I used to hate writing assignments but now I enjoy them. I realized that the purpose of writing is to inflate weak ideas obscure poor reasoning and inhibit clarity. With a little practice writing can be an intimidating and impenetrable fog! Want to see my book report? The Dynamics of Interbeing and Monological Imperatives in Dick and Jane: A Study in Psychic Transrelational Gender Modes. Academia here I come!
12/02/93
Here we are high on Rigor Mortis Ridge steeling ourselves for the terrifying descent into Grim Reaper Gorge! Why do we risk life and limb in a vertical free fall when we could be safe at home by the fire? Because it is mans indominable nature to scare himself silly for no good reason! If you make it home to the fire you can tell me how it was. See? This is why there were never any great animal explorers!
13/02/93
SMACK! AH HA HA HA! That was hilarious! Ha ha ha! POW! A joke is never as funny the second time you hear it.
14/02/93
140 million years ago the incredible ultrasaurs wander over the earth! Some weigh over 70 tons and even the vicious allosaurs are no match for these giants! But wait! A distant rumbling sends the ultrasaurs into a panicked stampede! Is it a volcano? Is it an earthquake? No! Its... its a Calvinosaurus! Named after the renowned archeologist who discovered it the huge calvinosaur can eat an ultrasaur in a single bit! Phooey! I never find ANYthing. It looks like youve hit the sewer pipe.
15/02/93
I should be doing my homework now. But the way I look at it playing in the snow is a lotm ore important. Out here Im learning real skills that I can apply throughout the rest of my life. Such as? Procrastinating and rationalizing.
16/02/93
Look at that! An angel. It must be a FALLEN angel! Generally they burn up in the atmosphere but this one apparently vaporized on impact leaving this angel-shaped crater in the snow! There are more over there. God mustve been punting angels left and right. Strange that there would be so many in Susies front yard. Ill bet theyre all related to her.
17/02/93
Im making a monumental heroic snow sculpture. It will be called The Triumph of Perseverence. Very inspiring. What will it look like? This. Youre through? Im bored.
18/02/93
Its like shooting fish in a barrel.
19/02/93
Look at this! This is the biggest snowball in the world! Ha ha! I cant wait to plaster somebody with it! How are you going to pick it up? Reality continues to ruin my life. Maybe you could put it someplace where someone will walk into it.
20/02/93
Im not going to do this homework! Cmon lets go outside! Nobody gives the evil eye like your Dad. Did you see how his veins throbbed?
21/02/93
I can never enjoy sundays because in the back of my mind I always know Ive got to go to school the next day. Its like trying to enjoy your last meal before the execution. A penny for your thoughts. Sorry MY thoughts are a buck a piece. A DOLLAR?! Thats outrageous. Your thoughts arent worth that! This one is. At a dollar its the bargain of a lifetime. I wouldnt pay a nickle for any thought youve ever had in your whole flea-ridden existence! That little remary just made the price ten dollars! TEN?? You cant extort me! Keep your stupid though! If you knew what it was youd BEG to pay ten bucks for it. Cmon just tell me what it is will you? Nothing doing pal. OK OK. Ill give you 25 cents. Thats all I have. Lets see it. Here! 25 cent! Now whats this big expensive thought of yours?! A fool and his money are soon par...
22/02/93
Whats in the big bag? Nothing YOU need to know about. Cmon tell me! Well lets just say its something that might come in handy today. Why? What happens today? Weve got a history test remember? So what did you bring? A bomb? Wouldnt you and the Principal BOTH like to know!
23/02/93
Why wont you tell me whats in that bag? Its a severed head. It is NOT! Dont be disgusting! Fine. Dont believe me. You said it would come in handy during todays test. The head is an oracle. Ill put it on my desk and it will tell me answers. Forget I asked! I dont even care! SOOOOSIE IS A BOOGER BRAAINN! It speaks the truth!
24/02/93
Here are your tests. You may begin. Can I get something from my locker? What do you need? I cant tell you. Then sit and do your test. Youre spoiling a great surprise for the class! It would be a great surprise for ME if youd just get to work.
25/02/93
Cough cough cough. Can I get a drink of water? OK but hurry up. THIS is a job for...
26/02/93
To avoid detection while changing identities mild-mannered Calvin leaps into his locker! There he makes the stupendous transformation into... STUPENDOUS MANNN! Da ta da tum tum da ta da tum tum. Gosh its dark in here. Wheres that darn handle?
27/02/93
BANG BANG BANG. I cant get out! Hmm... this is a REAL job for Stupendous Man! Bang bang bang bang bang. Heck this may even be a job for the custodian.
28/02/93
Here comes somebody! This meeting of the top secret club G.R.O.S.S. (Get Rid Of Slimy girlS) will come to order. Today this august assembly will decide whether to demote President Hobbes on charges of heresy! HERESY?! Let the record show that the defendent made an UNdisparaging comment about the possible membership of Susie Derkins an admitted girl and enemy of this club. Let the record ALSO show that Supreme Dictator-for-Life Calvin is a nincompoop. OK just for that youre also charged with insubordination! This court finds you guilty on both counts and strips you of your title! Ha! As court stenographer I refuse to enter the verdict! In fact Im PROMOTING myself to El Tigre Numero Uno! Oh yeah?! Well then I promote MYself to Most highest grandest exalted um supreme uh... There! I wrote Hobbes equals great in the official club notebook! Now its a law! IT IS NOT! GIMME THAT! Ha ha ha! IM writing Hobbes equals ugly fur ball! What do you think of THAT? Oh ho! I take the supreme dictator hat! Now IM the supreme dictator! You give that back! I declare you null and void! Truce? Truce. What a great club. Too bad we dont have more members. Maybe we should allow Susie to join.
01/03/93
Wheres Calvin? Didnt he come back from the drinking fountain? Ill bet hes at his locker Miss Wormwood. He brought something secret in a paper bag today that he said would help him on the test. Five years until retirement. Five years until retirement. STUPENDOUS MANs stupendous powers are of no avail in this cunning trap! Zounds! Its STUPENDOUS MANs fiendish nemesis the crab teacher coming to finish him off! Calvin?
02/03/93
Lets see if Calvin got whatever was in his locker. With stupendous muscles of magnitude Stupendous Man breaks free!! What on earth?! S.. for Stupendous! T... for Tiger ferocity of! U.. for Underwear red! P.. for Power incredible! E... for Excellent physique! N... for ...um... something... hm well Ill come back to that... D... for Determination! U... for... wait how do you spell this? Is it I?? Its not enough that we have to be disciplinarians. Now we need to be psychologists. Your nefarious scheme will never succeed!
03/03/93
Stupendous Man escapes! A crimson bold bursts through the air! Calvin come back here! Now its off to apply my stupendous powers of concentration to the history test of my alter ego mild-mannered Calvin! TA-DAA! Have no fear boys and girls! Im Stupendous Man champion of liberty and justice! Try to restrain yourselves girls! Im just here to do Calvins test. He lives on YOUR street doesnt he? I hardly even KNOW him Candance!
04/03/93
Stupendous Mans stupendous knowledge lets him complete the test with stupendous speed! 1492! The battle of Lexington! Trotsky! The cotton gin! Another triumph for virtue and right! And now with a whoosh Stupendous Man is off into the sky! So long kids! Always brush your teeth! Kapwinggg! Class did Calvin come in here?! Has anyone seen him? Here I am Miss Wormwood! Boy was I thirsty!
05/03/93
AAAUGHH! Let go! Let go! Youve got the wrong guy! Im Calvin! I didnt do anything wrong! BONK CRASH. I just got a drink of water! You SAID I could! Stupendous Man is the one you want! Im not him! Help! Help! SCRAPE DRAG. Class YOU saw Stupendous Man! Tell Miss Wormwood! ARRGGH! Help! Ive been falsely accused! CRUNCH CLUNK. When Mom asks me how my day at school was I always just say Fine and change the subject. NO! NO!
06/03/93
So the teacher told Mom and Mom hit the roof and took away my costume. Yikes. Um... has Stupendous Man EVER won a battle? Well theyre all MORAL victories. One cant be picky. Oh and I flunked the test too.
07/03/93
Sssss ssssss. If theres more to life than this I dont know what it is.
08/03/93
Theyre snowmen prophets of doom. You certainly take the pleasure out of waiting for daffodils.
09/03/93
ATCHOOO! Uh oh. Im leaking brain lubricant.
10/03/93
Look Hobbes. Theres a quiz in my new issue of Chewing magazine. Does your gum deliver? 10 questions show what you could be missing! Lets see how my gum does. 1. How hard is your gum at the beginning? A) Rock-like or brittle B) Pleasantly firm C) Squishy or bendy. Hmm... my gum is pretty hard at first. Ill mark A. Gosh Ive got a negative five points already! Im not getting all the performance Im entitled to! I wonder what people knew before there were magazine quizzes.
11/03/93
OK youve all read the chapter so lets review. Calvin where was the Byzantine Empire? Ill take Outer Planets for $100.
12/03/93
MOM! WAKE UP! COME QUICK! Whats wrong? Whats the matter? Do you think love is nothing but a biochemical reaction designed to make sure our genes get passed on? Whatever it is its all thats keeping me from strangling you right now. Moms midnight assurances are never very reassuring.
13/03/93
When youre a kid you dont have much variety of experience. You live with your parents and thats all you know. You grow up thinking whatever they do is normal. Ahh what a day! Up at 6:00 a 10-mile run in the sleet and NOW a big bowl of plain oatmeal! How I love the crazy hedonism of weekends! Well maybe normal is too strong a word. I think wed know normal if we saw it.
14/03/93
Get up Calvin! Im not going to call you again! I bet. Youre going to miss the bus! Now get out of bed! You dont know the answer? Then sit down. Hey Twinky want to see if theres an afterlife? No you cant go play until you finish your homework. Just eat your food. You dont need to play with it. Stop stalling and get into the bathtub. No you cant stay up a little longer. Go to bed. Have a good nights sleep. Tomorrows another big! ... sighhhhhhh...
15/03/93
Rrgggh... 125... Oof. Rrrggh... 5200! Exercise is a lot more gratifying if you count what it FEELS like.
16/03/93
I dont want to get up. I dont want to get dressed. I dont want to wait for the bus. I dont want to go to school. I dont want to listen to the teacher. I dont want to study. I dont want any tests. I dont want any homework. How was your day? It pitched a perfect no-hitter.
17/03/93
You know ther emust be thousands of animal species and of ALL of them only humans wear clothes. Isnt that weird? I wonder why other animals dont wear clothes. If our naked pink butts showed we probably would. Our butts are just fine!
18/03/93
Im going outside. Are you done with your homework? Yes. You read the whole chapter? Lets just leave it that Im done. Back to your room buster.
19/03/93
Ill bet SOME kids walk around corners without even thinking about it. That was a rotten trick.
20/03/93
Gravity must pull especially hard on tigers. Thats an impression we like to cultivate.
21/03/93
Three... two... one... LIGHT SPEED! Blasting across the galaxy in hyper light drive its Spaceman Spiff interplanetary explorer extraordin... Since Calvin seems to be enjoying the lesson lets have him demonstrate the next problem. ZOONDS! A Zok death sloop appears out of nowhere and fries Spiffs stabilizers! Our hero hurls out of control towar his imminent doom! The situation is desperate! This could be the end! What can our hero do?? His mind racing furiously Spiff springs into action! He downshifts his spacecraft and ... stalls. RINGG! Oh darn out of time. Once again Spaceman Spiff beats all odds to save the day!
22/03/93
Look at these TV commercials. Each one is a jumble of lightning quick unrelated images and film techniques. It duplicates the effect of rapidly flipping through channels. Its a barrage of non-linear free association. I guess theyre admitting that a 15-second commercial exceeds the American attention span by a good 14 seconds. Huh? Are you still talking about that?
23/03/93
Scientific names? Sure. Scientists come up with great wild theories but then they give them dull unimaginative names. For example scientists think space is full of mysterious invisible mass so what do they call it? DARK matter! Duhh! I tell you theres a fortune to be made here! I like to say quark! Quark quark quark quark! Instead of making an idiot of yourself why dont you go find me some scientists?
24/03/93
Miss Wormwood I protest this C grade! Thats saying I only did an average job! I got 75% of the answers correct and in todays society doing something 75% right is outstanding! If government and industry were 75% competent wed be ecstatic! I wont stand for this artificial standard of performance! I demand an A for this kind of work! I think its really gross how she drings Mallox straight from the bottle.
25/03/93
History will thank me for keeping this journal at such a young age. As one of those rare individuals destined for true greatness this record of my thoughts and convictions will provide invaluable insight into budding genius. Think of it! A priceless historical document in the making! Wow! ... so who ELSE should I add to my list of total jerks? Who else do you even know?
26/03/93
Wait Dad! Ive got a great idea! Dont shave next to your mouth OK? Let the whiskers grow about a foot long and then wax em so they stick straight out! Then youll look like a big cat! Dad didnt think the firm would go for it. Preposterous!
27/03/93
Tiger! Tiger! Burning bright in the forests of the night. Blake wrote that. Apparently the tiger was on fire. Maybe his tail got struck by lightning or something. Flammable felines -- what a weird subject for poetry. That is why I try to sleep through most of the day.
28/03/93
Whenever I need to do some serious thinking I go for a walk in the woods. There are always a million distractions out here. I dont believe in ethics any more. As far as Im concerned the ends justify the means. Get what you can while the gettings good - thats what I say! Might makes right! The winners write the history books! Its a dog-eat-dog world so Ill do whatever I have to and let others argue about whether its rightor not. HEYY! WHYD YOU DO THAT?!? You were in my way. Now youre not. The ends justify the means. I didnt mean for EVERYONE you dolt! Just ME! Ahh...
29/03/93
BORRRING. Yeah yeah... Kill the messenger.
30/03/93
Hello county library? Reference desk please. Thank you. Hello? Yes I need a book on painting theory and technique. Specifically Im interested in graffiti. Is there a book that explains the proper use of materials and lists popular dirty words and slogans? What on earth do they spend their money on over there?
31/03/93
Calvin: Memoirs of a Six-Year-Old. My life has been a fascinating series of amazing exploits about which I have many profound insights. But frankly none of it is any of your darn business so butt out! The end. Do publishers demand that manuscripts be typed? I wouldnt sweat it.
01/04/93
AAUGH! The peanut butter is ruined! Youre supposed to scoop one half straight down and then dig out the other side from the bottom so part of the top remains undisturbed until the very end! What on earth for? Its a ritual! You have to keep the top of the peanut butter smooth! Maybe you should make your own sandwiches. If you cant control your peanut butter you cant expect to control your life. Did you cut the bread diagonally?
02/04/93
AAAUGH! AAUGHH! Somethings crawling down my left! Get it out! ... oh its just a couple of pennies. Ive got a hole in my pocket. *Whew* You never know when some crazed rodent with cold feet might be running lose in your pants. Another reason not to wear em.
03/04/93
Do you think babies are born sinful? That they come into the world as sinners? No I think theyre just quick studies. Whenever you discuss certain things with animals you get insulted.
04/04/93
Z Z. Boy rough life huh? What have YOU done today?! People!
05/04/93
The TV listings say this movie has adult situations. What are adult situations? Probably things like going to work paying bills and taxes taking responsibilities... Wow! They dont kid around when they say For mature audiences. Ive never understood how those movies make any money.
06/04/93
BANG WHANG CLANG ZANG PANG BLANG. WILL YOU STOP THAT AWFUL RACKET?! YOURE DRIVING ME CRAZY! ... and a check mark for Tuesday!
07/04/93
Miss Wormwood? Yes Calvin? My generation doesnt absorb information this way. Could you reduce everything to factoids? Turn to page 21 class. At least televisions understand us.
08/04/93
I hate it when its this windy. You know what I hate? I hate when Im talking and someone turns the conversation to himself! Its so rude! Why do they think Im talking?! Its so they can hear about ME! Who cares what THEY have to say! If I start a conversation it should stay on the subject of ME! I also hate it when people look at me all bug-eyed. That must happen a lot.
09/04/93
How many boards would the Mongols hoard if the Mongol hordes got bored?
10/04/93
No sense putting it off. Its time for spring cleaning. Good for you. What about the HOUSE? What ABOUT the house?
11/04/93
IM HOME! YAHHHH SLAM! What a chump! KNOCK KNOCK Forget it you moron! Im not opening the door! You can just stay out there all night! Oh I cant WAIT to here THIS one explained.
12/04/93
Its a funny world Hobbes. True. But its not a hilarious world. ...unless you like sick humor. The world is probably funnier to people who dont live here.
13/04/93
Oh good a true or false test! At last some clarity! Every sentence is either pure sweet truth or a vile contemptible lie! One or the other! Nothing in between!
14/04/93
Im at peace with the world. Im completely serene. Why is that? Ive discovered my purpose in life. I know why I was put here and why everything exists. Oh really? Yes I am here so everybody can do what I want. Its nice to have that cleared up. Once everyone accepts it theyll be serene too.
15/04/93
Ahh spring! I say lets move on to summer.
16/04/93
I thrive on change. YOU?! You threw a fit this morning because your Mom put less jelly on your toast than yesterday! I thrive on making OTHER people change.
17/04/93
Eww mud. Look at this gooshy dirty slimy thick wet muck. Blecchh. Talk about a kid magnet.
18/04/93
True friends are hard to come by. I need more money. I wish people were more like animals. Animals dont try to change you or make you fit in. They just enjoy the pleasure of your company. Animals arent conditional about friendships. Animals like you just the way you are. They listen to your problems they comfort you when youre sad and all they ask in return is a little kindness. WHOOONK! *SOB* Its so... so TRUE! HOOOOT! THBPBTPTH! ... and speaking of a little kindness Id have a tuna fish sandwich any time soon that you happen to make one. Of course SOME animals get on your nerves once in a while.
19/04/93
Susie I think its only fair to tell you that there is absolutely no way I would even CONSIDER asking you to the senior prom. Thats eleven YEARS from now! I figure that might give you enough time to find somebody who will. If Id known her longer I couldve given her more notice.
20/04/93
Z. I think tigers are actually classified as liquids. Har har.
21/04/93
F?! It seems to me that if Im not learning this material you must not be a very good teacher! Wogga muk gubba pum wup! Boo! Gop! What??
22/04/93
Is this milk spoiled? Smell it and see. IM not going to smell it! YOU smell it! Oh for goodness sake. Here... its fine. I dont take chances with a product that prints the date you might expire.
23/04/93
Curiosity is the essence of the scientific mind. For example you know how milk comes out your nose if you laugh while drinking? Well Im going to see what happens when I inhale milk INTO my nose and laugh! Idiocy is the essence of the male mind. Im guessing it will shoot out my ears. Dont you want to see??
24/04/93
I think Ill count all the rocks I can find. 400 trillion and three 400 trillion and four 400 trillion and five...Wow I bored myself awake.
25/04/93
Mild-mannered Calvin is stuck inside doing math problems on a beautiful Sunday. No one is watching! He dashes into his closet! THIS is a job for .... STUPENDOUS MAN! Defender of freedom! Advocate of liberty! A bright crimson streak blasts up through the atmosphere and then turns back toward Earth! Gaining stupendous momentum STUPENDOUS MAN strikes the ground at an acute angle with stupendous force! The Earth slowly stops rotating... and begins to turn in the opposite direction! Pushing with all his might STUPENDOUS MAN turns the planet all the way around backwards! The sun sets in the east and rises in the west! Soon its 10A.M. the previous day! What are you doing outside? Did you finish your homework already? Its Saturday! I dont need to do it until tomorrow... thanks to STUPENDOUS MAN!
26/04/93
Want to help me make a poster? Sure. Whats it for? Its a school contest. Were supposed to do traffic safety posters. The winner gets five bucks! Wow! Think of it! Well be rich! And then theres the fame and glory! I tell you this could be our ticket out of this two-bit dump! Sounds good. Whats our winning poster going to say? Thats where YOU come in.
27/04/93
Our traffic safety poster needs a catchy slogan that promotes awareness and caution. Any ideas? How about Dont look into car headlights and freeze because youll either get run over or shot! Ill check the statistics but I dont think that happens to many people. Theres more to this world than just people you know.
28/04/93
Hey Dad Im doing a traffic safety poster. Do you have any ideas for a slogan? Sure! Cyclists have a right to the road too you noisy polluting inconsiderate maniacs! I hope gas goes up to eight bucks a gallon! Thanks Dad. Ill go ask Mom. Why? Thats a GREAT slogan!
29/04/93
Mom suggested the slogan Before you cross look each way... and youll get home safe each day. Thats kind of catchy. Yeah but I like MY idea better. Be careful or be roadkill! I suppose that lends itself more to your particular brand of illustration. I hope I have enough cadmium red.
30/04/93
With my great slogan and your great artwork this traffic safety poster is a shoe-in for first prize! A solid foundation of anatomical study is essential for the artist. What should we spend the prize money on? Of course technical skill alone isnt enough. A picture needs depth of feeling. I think Ill blog it all on jaw breakers and comic books. Ill draw some stars to show pain and human suffering. When youve got talent like ours the world is your oyster.
01/05/93
There! Finished! Hey thats terrific! When we win first prize Ill give you 25% of the winnings. WHAT?! I did all the drawing! YOU should get 25% But it was MY great idea! Well split 60-40. 50-50. Oh all right BE selfish! A good compromise leaves everybody mad.
02/05/93
ATCHOO! Booger balls are illegal! Whap! First base! Fifth! Ninth! Puff puff ELEVENTH! puff TWENTY-FIFTH! Calvins going for home! Too late! Youre out! I think we need to change the rules. Oh you want to play the sissy way now I bet.
03/05/93
Hi Calvin. I see you wasted your time drawing a safety poster for the school contest. I didnt waste my time! Sure you did. The winning entry is right here. The prize is as good as mine. Be careful or be roadkill! Thats really disgusting. Thank you. What IS that all over the drawing? Chunky spaghetti sauce!
04/05/93
Who would like to show his or her traffic poster first? I WOULD! I WOULD! All right Calvin. Step up front. Thank you! My poster says Be careful or be roadkill! Drawn in patent-pending 3-D gore-o-rama this picture will actually attract flies because the drawing is splattered with spaghetti sauce! I can see youre all just sick about your chances of winning.
05/05/93
Well Hobbes all we have to do now is wait for the judges to award our poster first prize and well be rolling in moolah and prestige. You know we really ought to enter more contests. I never realized how much fun it is to win! But we havent won YET. But we WILL and then everyone will know how great we are. Dont they already? Oh you know how people are. They only recognize greatness when some authority confirms it.
06/05/93
Look Calvin My poster WON! HUH?!
07/05/93
Our poster didnt win? I still cant believe it. What a miscarriage of justice! This contest was a joke! Obviously the judges were biased against us from the start! Well the important thing is that we tried our best. The IMPORTANT thing is that we LOST! Oops I always forget the purpose of competition is to divide people into winners and losers. Whats the point of trying if you cant be a winner?
08/05/93
Dad my poster didnt win the contest! I think the judges were on the take and the whole thing was rigged! I want you to call the school board have them declare a fraud and make them take the prize away from Susie and give it to ME! Calvin losing is a part of life. You should learn to be a good sport about it and keep things in perspective. After all winning isnt everything. Is that really what they believe on the planet youre from? Youve been watching athletic shoe ads again havent you?
09/05/93
The late Cretaceous period ... when dinosaurs ruled the Earth! And Calvin ruled the dinosaurs! The terrible Tyrannosaurus sinks it teeth into a triceratops! Triumphant again the undisputed king of dinosaurs lets out a mighty roar! With savage ferocity the monster begins its feast! Limb-severing bone-crushing and tendon-snapping he ... Calvin! Thats disgusting! For heavens sake slow down and chew quietly! The terrible Tyrannosaurus resumes eating mortified that someone might see him.
10/05/93
I know more about the private lives of celebrities than I do about any governmental policy that will actually affect me. Im interested in things that are none of my business and Im bored by things that are important to know. The media aim to please. Maybe the economy should be discussed in cheap motel rooms.
11/05/93
A million things that bug me. 1. Dried-out catsup on the bottle rim. 2. Toast crumbs in the butter. 3. Mushy bananas. 4. Worms on the sidewalk. 5. Skin on pudding. 6. Making a hand gesture for quotation marks. 7. Raisins. How about excessively negative people? Yeah thats a good one. ...HEY!
12/05/93
Want to see me juggle? I can keep a dozen eggs in the air at once! HUHH! ACKPTH! Notice I didnt say I could do it for very long. This rug must need a thicker pad.
13/05/93
This tiger is sprawled so still and so flat a question arises when glancing thereat. Is he asleep? To be perfectly frank he looks more as if he was creamed by a tank! AAAUGH
14/05/93
Do you believe in evolution? No. You dont think humans evolved from monkeys? I sure dont see any difference. Woo hoo hoo!
15/05/93
Theres nothing good on TV. Then turn it off. Turn it OFF?? You mean I should just sit here staring at a blank screen all day?! Oh.
16/05/93
I cant sleep. I think nighttime is dark so you can imagine your fears with less distraction. At nighttime the world always seem so big and scary and I always seem so small. I wish I could fall asleep so it would be morning. Sighhhh... Look at Hobbes. HES asleep. Z. Heh heh... he sure looks funny when he sleeps. Tigers close their eyes so tight. I wonder what hes dreaming about. Good ol Hobbes. What a friend. Z. Things are never quite as scary when youve got a best friend. Z Z Z Z
17/05/93
Lets find some slugs and worms. Why do we want to find slugs and worms? Because theyre gross. Thats why one AVOIDS slugs and worms. If we avoid them we cant dare each other to eat one. Toodle-oo. Whats the matter with you?! You dont like FUN?!
18/05/93
Hey Susie! Do you dare me to eat this worm?? Just one? Um... well yeah. Dont you think thats disgusting? See him wriggle? Eating five at once would be disgusting. I dont know about just one. You want me to eat FIVE?! Geeeez! Whod have thought disgust would be so inflationary?!
19/05/93
OK Susie I got five worms. But it will cost you 50 cents to see me eat them. 50 cents?! Id only pay 50 cents if you ate 50 worms. Thats a penny a worm. Right. Ill give you a nickel to eat those five. Five cents?! What if I have to go to the hospital because of this? Oh all right. Ill throw in another nickel if you go to the hospital. ...not so fast! First prove you even HAVE two nickels!
20/05/93
OK give me the nickel and Ill eat the worms. No you eat the worms and THEN Ill give you the nickel. How about two cents up front and the rest upon completing the job? Sorry! You dont get paid until you do the work. Man youd think the guy eating the worms would be calling the shots! Usually if youre calling any shots youre not eating worms.
21/05/93
Ready? Five worms down the hatch! Here goes! Closer... closer... wriggling squirming dirty slimy worms! Closer... closer! Boy theyre really close now! How revolting! Closer... closer! Um... feel free to run away screaming any time. Not with my nickel at stake.
22/05/93
Calvin WHAT are you doing? Im eating worms for a nickel! No youre not! Time for you to come home! And Susie its mean to take advantage of kids with no common sense. AW MOM YOU SPOIL EVERYTHING! What a relief! Thanks Mom. Great timing. If I havent seen you for two minutes I figure theres trouble.
23/05/93
How long till youre done? At least 15 minutes. Plus drying. ...sighhhh... Im bored. Theres nothing to do. Nothing to do?!? Its a beautiful summer day! Youve got the whole outdoors to play in! If you cant find something to do its because you havent tried. Go on! Use some imagination! My upbringing is filled with inconsistent messages.
24/05/93
Little joys of life. 1. Reading a new comic book. 2. Petting a happy dog. 3. Getting a letter in the mail. 4. Eating the marshmallows in hot chocolate. 5. Smiling when a big kid calls you a nasty name... and then punching his teeth straight down his ugly neck. You really pull the ol heartstrings. Some of these I havent personally experienced sad to say.
25/05/93
Look Hobbes. This world is kind of like TV. A casual observer might even confuse the two. But if you notice here the colors are less intense and the people are uglier. Also I see that several minutes can go by without a single car chase explosion murder or pat personal exchange. Why settle for less hmm? Shh. This is my favorite deodorant commercial.
26/05/93
Youre a bat-faced bug-eyed booger-nosed baloney-brained beetle-butt! This volunteer social work just isnt for me.
27/05/93
Today for show and tell Ive brought in some flash cards I made. Each card has a letter followed by several dashes. When I show you the card you yell the vulgar obscene or blasphemous word they stand for! ...Ready? Shes such a hypocrite about building vocabulary.
28/05/93
I believe personal greed justifies everything. Also private lives are legitimate public entertainment. And the lowest common denominator is always right! Do I have career options or what? I think I need to start hanging around with other animals.
29/05/93
Ooh! Ahh! Eee! POP. It couldve happened! Only corn does that. Add some cold water and get back in the tub.
30/05/93
Historical marker. Calvins house. In January some 40 snowmen met a gruesome fate on this spot. Every day I look for a moving van here. Knock knock. Great moons of neptune! A fool mortal female! Calvin? IM not Calvin! Im Stupendous Man! Friend of freedom! Opponent of oppressions! Uh huh. What are you doing? I was just about to use my stupendous powers to liberate some cookies being held hostage on the top shelf of the pantry! Now if youll excuse me duty calls! SLAM! A blot of crimson streaks across the sky! The man of mega-might is off to save the day! Did they have an egg you could borrow? No one was home Mom.
31/05/93
Im not going to school any more. Oh? Nope! Ive decided to be a hunter-gatherer when I grow up! Ill be living naked in a tropical forest subsisting on berries grubs and the occasional frog and spend my free time grooming for lice! All the experts say its bad parenting to squelch a kids ambitions.
01/06/93
Miss Wormwood I have a question about this math lesson. Yes? Give that sooner or later were all just going to die whats the point of learning about integers? Turn to page 83 class. Nobody likes us big picture people.
02/06/93
The problem with people is they dont look at the big picture. Eventually were going to die our species will go extinct the sun will explode and the universe will collapse. Existence is not only temporary its pointless! Were all doomed and worse nothing matters! I see why people dont like to look at the big picture. Well it puts a bad day in perspective.
03/06/93
Miss Wormwood could we arrange our seats in a circle and have a little discussion? Specifically Id like to debate whether cannibalism ought to be grounds for leniency in murders since its less wasteful. For some reason theyd rather teach us stuff that any fool can look up in a book.
04/06/93
I flunked a test today. But I dont mind. No? Its a question of priorities Hobbes. A mans got to make room for what he cares about. These days are precious and Id rather spend them goofing around than studying. I never really thought of ignorance as a quality of life issue. Apparently neither has Dad.
05/06/93
You know why birds dont write their memoirs? Because birds dont lead epic lives thats why! Whod want to read what a bird does? Nobody thats who! This is changing the subject but have you ever noticed how somebody can say something totally loony and not be aware of it? What are you supposed to do just let it slide?? Sometimes if you wait hell top himself. I say just punch im then and there!
06/06/93
Oh no! Everything has suddenly turned neo-cubist! It all started when Calvin engaged his Dad in a minor debate! Soon Calvin could see both sides of the issue! Then poor Calvin began to see both sides of EVERYthing! The traditional single viewpoint has been abandoned! Perspective has been fractured! The multiple views provide too much information! Its impossible to move! Calvin quickly tries to eliminate all but one perspective! It works! The world falls into recognizable order! Youre still wrong Dad.
07/06/93
THIS IS A BIG FAT WASTE OF MY TIME! HELLPP!! ITS THE THOUGHT POLICE!
08/06/93
Want to hear a joke? Sure! OK this guy goes into a bar. No wait he doesnt do that yet. Or maybe its a grocery store. OK it doesnt matter. Lets say its a bar. Hes somewhere in the vicinity of a bar right? So anyway theres this dog and he says something odd I dont remember but this other guy says um well I forget but it was funny. Ill try to imagine it. Yeah youll really laugh.
09/06/93
Hello? Hello. Is your mother home? What business is it of YOURS jerk?! SLAM! Some people sure are nosy. I left three messages today and nobody returned my call. How rude.
10/06/93
I think we should get an answering machine. Ugh I dont. If you have a machine you feel obligated to return a bunch of calls youd rather not have received in the first place. WITHOUT a machine you can just let the phone ring and eventually the caller gives up and you dont have to talk to him. That wasnt quite my point. Thats the problem at work. The secretaries wont ignore the phone so Im always talking to people.
11/06/93
The more you think about things the weirder they seem. Take this milk. Why do we drink COW milk?? Who was the guy who first looked at a cow and said I think Ill drink whatever comes out of these things when I squeeze em!? Isnt that weird? I think conversation should be kept to a minimum until afternoon.
12/06/93
Ive been disempowered. My centering self-actualizing anima has been impacted by toxic co-dependent dysfunctionality! Youve been temporarily inconvenienced. Take out the trash. ARE YOU SAYING THERES A DIFFERENCE?!
13/06/93
Do re mi fa so la ti do. A sparrow alights upon a tree branch. But this is no ORDINARY sparrow. This is a SONG sparrow. Swaying gently in the breeze he prepares to burst forth a rapturious melody! ON TOP OF SPAGHETTI ALL COVERED WITH CHEEEESE I LOST MY POOR MEEEATBALLL WHEN...
14/06/93

15/06/93
Dad what causes wind? Trees sneezing. Really?? No but the truth is more complicated. The trees are really sneezing today.
16/06/93
What do you think that cloud looks like? A bunch of suspended water and ice particles... why? Everybody hates a literalist.
17/06/93
Mom can I have the car keys? No. Can you believe the encyclopedia doesnt have an entry for hotwire?
18/06/93
When I spit I get pretty good saliva cohesion but Im still not getting much distance or accuracy. I think the problem lies in the mix of phlegm. If you dont get that critical mucus mass you just... ...Hobbes? Nobody likes to hear about a hobby.
19/06/93
You know what I like to do when someones talking to me? I stare at the persons chin. Ill nod and respond to whatever hes saying. But I keep looking at his chin and changing my expression. I look quizzical at first then vaguely repulsed and later quietly amused. Then Ill suddenly arch my eyebrows and blink a lot and then I look skeptical and disbelieving. You get bonus points every time the person loses his train of thought. Ill bet your natural charm has made you a good sprinter.
20/06/93
Oh Calvin would you please empty this in the garage trash can? Boy some vacation THIS summer is!
21/06/93
What if theres no afterlife? Suppose this is all we get? Oh what the heck. Ill take it anyway. Yeah but if Im not going to be eternally rewarded for good behavior Id sure like to know NOW.
22/06/93
Phup phupp phup PHBBTTB. Hey that was a GOOD one! Thank you. Its funny how you never see Mom and Dad practice these. Phup phup. Theyre probably good at it already.
23/06/93
I watched an old movie with Mom last night. It didnt have any violence explosive action or swearing. There was nothing shocking about it at all. Did you like it? Its hard to say. Not having my emotions manipulated is such a weird experience.
24/06/93
Thursday Day 4. Light winds good humidity. Progress slow getting discouraged. Im only burping - not truly BELCHING. Mellow roundness remains elusive. Harmonics coming along with developing amplitude. Hang in there! They say you should keep a log when you take up a sport.
25/06/93
The literary world is abuzz about Mabel Syrups sequel to Hamster Huey and the Gooey Kablooie. We have to buy it! Its called Commander Coriander Salamander and er Singlehander Bellylander! Achitects should be forced to live in the buildings they design and childrens book authors should be forced to read their stories aloud every single night of their rotten lives.
26/06/93
Hobbes is laughing in his sleep. Hee hee he. Psst! Whats so funny? Zzz... shh Im going to pounce on Calvin... zz... hee hee... RUN FOR YOUR LIFE CALVIN!
27/06/93
Another one of THESE days. Uh oh! In another of lifes mysterious quirks Calvin finds himself an inch tall on the writing desk! His only hope is to tear off a sheet from a nearby pad of paper! At his tiny size folding the sheet is difficult but soon Calvins patience is rewarded. He pushes off and catches a small thermal rising up the front of the desk! A gust from an open window sends Calvin soaring across the house! Theres Dad! Lean! Lean! Yes! Calvin is able to steer! THIS should get Dads attention! I dont need parents. All I need is a recording that says Go play outside!
28/06/93
Mom and Dad say I should make my life an example of the principles I believe in. But every time I do they tell me to stop it. Im not sure that total self-indulgence is really a principle.
29/06/93
Like delicate lace so the threads intertwine Oh gossamer web of wondrous design! Such beauty and grace wild nature produces... Ughh look at the spider suck out that bugs juices!
30/06/93
I read that scientists are trying to make computers that THINK. Isnt that weird?? If computers can think what will people be better at than machines? Irrational behavior. Maybe theyll invent a psychotic computer.
01/07/93
I need a push! Somebody come and give me a push! RRRGGHHH. Where the heck is the manual override?!
02/07/93
If you stick your tongue out for a long time it dries up! Try it! Why would anyone want his tongue to dry up?! Because then it feels really weird when you touch it. Ill take your word for it. Some people just arent open to revelatory experiences.
03/07/93
ZZIZZZZ WHIPP FLIP ZZZZ ZZZZ FWAP! ZIPPPP ZZZZZ. The only skills I have the patience to learn are those that have no application in real life.

Another day another dollar... ...another irreplaceable chunk out of a finite and rapidly passing lifetime. What a beautiful summer day... and Ive got to spend it in an office. Brother. It seems like Im always rushing off and never taking the time to enjoy days like this. Id sure like to have a quiet day around the house. No traffic no schedule no phone calls... boy that would be great. I could spend some time with Calvin read a book go on a bike ride... Maybe I should take the day off. The world wouldnt end if I didnt go into the office today. Days like this dont come often and life is short. Hi Dad. Bye Dad. AUGHH. YOU GET BACK HERE AND PICK EVERY ONE OF THESE DEAD BUGS OUT OF MY SHAMPOO!! I MEAN NOW!
05/07/93
Can you make a living playing silly games? Actually you can be among the most overpaid people on the planet. ...sighhh...
06/07/93
I am the worlds most powerful computer. Ask me a question. Why does the worlds most powerful computer wear little red sneakers?
07/07/93
I am the worlds most powerful computer. Ask me a question. Did Calvin clean his room as I asked him to or did he spend the whole morning playing with a cardboard box? Um... system error... delete question and try again. What happened? Mom booted me up here.
08/07/93
From now on Im not doing anything I dont want to do! The world OWES me happiniess fulfillment and success. Well lucky you! Yeah Im just here to cash in.
09/07/93
What assurance do I have that parenting isnt screwing me up?
10/07/93
Where are YOU going? Out. Did you pick up your room? I tried. But I couldnt lift it! GET IT?? AH HA HA HA HA HA! For some reason the sound of childrens laughter doesnt make Mom sentimental.
11/07/93
How long till youre done? At least 15 minutes. Plus drying. ...sighhhh... Im bored. Theres nothing to do. Nothing to do?!? Its a beautiful summer day! Youve got the whole outdoors to play in! If you cant find something to do its because you havent tried. Go on! Use some imagination! My upbringing is filled with inconsistent messages.
12/07/93
Gorgeous morning. Huh Dad? Mm. These summer days sure slip by dont they? Too bad the daily drudgery of making a living has to keep you from appreciating these sublime moments of life. Well best not to think about it! If you stay healthy you can enjoy days like this when you retire! See you tonight! Ahhh. Summer!
13/07/93
Look what Ive got! What is it? Its the box a bar of soap comes in. Its a tradition that when you harangue the multitudes you stand on a soap box. Youd probably be more impressive if you tried using the soap. Let me know if you see any multitudes.
14/07/93
I have a very sarcastic mother.
15/07/93
My elbows are grass-stained Ive got sticks in my hair Im covered with bug bites and cuts and scratches... Ive got sand in my socks and leaves in my shirt my hands are sticky with sap and my shoes are soaked! Im hot dirty sweaty itchy and tired. I say consider this day seized! Tomorrow well seize the day and throttle it!
16/07/93
I saw your teacher Miss Wormwood in the supermarket today. She said to say Hi. You saw Miss Wormwood?? She shops at the supermarket? Well certainly. What did you think? I dunno... I kinda figured teachers slept in coffins all summer.
17/07/93
WHAP. Dont ask dumb questions. Just ring y doorbell hold the bat and yell Ha ha! Why is that worth ten cents to you?
18/07/93
Call it. Heads. You said Tails right? I said HEADS. What a play! Ill bet it takes you four downs just to get back on the field! I think football is a sport the way ducks think hunting is a sport.
19/07/93
We dont understand what really causes events to happen. History is the fiction we invent to persuade ourselves that events are knowable and that life has order and direction. Thats why events are always reinterpreted when values change. We need new versions of history to allow for our current prejudices. So what are you writing? A revisionist autobiography.
20/07/93
A painting. Moving. Spiritually enriching. Sublime ... high art! The comic strip. Vapid. Juvenile. Commercial hack work ... low art. A painting of a comic strip panel. Sophisticated irony. Philosophically challenging. ... high art. Suppose I draw a cartoon of a painting of a comic strip? Sophomoric. Intellectually sterile. ...low art.
21/07/93
MOMM! HEY MOM! Calvin stop yelling across the house! If you want to talk to me walk over to the living room where I am! I stepped in dog doo. Wheres the hose?
22/07/93
Heres a bug plodding resolutely across the dirt. Put a rock in his way and he just goes around it. Flip him on his back and he rights himself and continues on his way. Hes focused determined and steadfast. If hes mocking me Im gonna goosh him.
23/07/93
YOWP! AHH! OOH! What a dumb ride on the hottest days you need the heaviest pands.
24/07/93
I hate going to bed before its dark out! Its not fair! Ill show Mom and Dad though! Theyll pay for this! If I have to go to bed while its still light then Im going to get up when its still dark!
25/07/93
To make instant fun... ...just add water! Heh heh heh FWOOSH. Hee hee. Looking for someone? Uh who? ME? Ha ha ha ha ha! Um no-o. I mean yes... but someone ELSE. Heh heh. Not you. Heres a hypothetical questionyou should ask yourself. If you knew today was your last day on earth what would you do different? ... ESPECIALLY if bu doing something DIFFERENT today might NOT be your last day on earth. I dont think that question was very hypothetical at all.
26/07/93
Jump jump jump jump jump jump jump jump! Ahh youve fallen into my trap! Maybe youd like to take that move over! Your remaining piece must have one heck of a plan.
27/07/93
These real-life video programs are great! Here are ordinary people having actual horrible experiences which are broadcast nationwide for the publics viewing amusement! Its intrusion exploitation and voyeurism all in one! You never know where a video camera will be! Everythings fair game! Whod have guessed big brother would go commercial? I love to snicker at other peoples tragedy.
28/07/93
Dad whats a control freak? Thats what lazy slipshod careless cut-corner workers call anyone who cares enough to do something right. Am I in the presence of their king? Should I kneel? If anything works in this world its because one of us took charge.
29/07/93
SPLOOSH! AAA! No! Wait! Think about it! Wasnt that refreshing?? I need to work on my salesmanship.
30/07/93
Mom says if I stay up here for two hours three days a week I dont have to take any lessons this summer.
31/07/93
I like people. Im interested in people. YOU?? As an audience I mean. Oh.
01/08/93
I got a goal! OH the score is oogy to boogy. I leady HAD oogy! You just ran into the invisible sector! You have to cover your eyes now because everything is invisible to yoU! Invisible sector?? I didnt know we had an invisible sector! Where is it? You cant see it. Its invisible. How do I know I went in it then? You cant see anything right? OK so how do I get out? Somebody bonks you with the calvinball. I get another point! HEY! OW! WHY YOU... That was a rotten rule! I decree no more invisible sectors! ... in fact Ill show YOU! YOU just ran into a vortex spot! You have to spin around until you fall down! Sorry this vortex spot is in the boomerang zone so the vortex turns to whoever calls it! YOU spin! THATS NOT FAIR! You know the calvinball rules. Yeah yeah anything we make up. Well youll pay for this. This game lends itself to certain abuses. Guess how you get out of the boomerang zone!
02/08/93
This meeting of the Get Rid Of Slimy girlS club will now come to order! First tiger Hobbes will read the minutes of our last meeting. Thank you. 9:30 - Meeting called to order. Dictator-for-life Calvin proposes resolution condemning existence of girls. 9:35 - First tiger Hobbes abstains from vote. Motion fails. 9:36 - Patriotism of first tiger called into question. 9:37 - Philosophical discussion. 10:15 - Bandages administered. Dictator-for-life rebuked for biting. Is this a great club or what? 10:16 - Forgot what the debate was about. Medals of bravery awarded to all parties.
03/08/93
Gentlemen the purpose of todays meeting is to devise another brilliant plan to annoy our enemy! Dictator-for-life Calvins bold proposal is greeted with huzzahs from membership. We have tolerated the enemys presence too long I say! Shouts of asset much pounding on tables. Three cheers erupt for club ideals. Membership reduced to tears. More huzzahs. Pandemonium ensues. Boy leading a club is a heady experience. Good meetings always turn into riots.
04/08/93
Field scout Calvin reports the enemy was sighted. Engaged in emeny activity on the sidewalk two doors down. As chief strategist I suggest... Excuse me. A question from the floor. The chair recognizes first tiger Hobbes. Exactly what enemy activity was the enemy engaged in? You know girl stuff! Ah. Say no more.
05/08/93
All right heres the plan! We make up a fake code with fake instructions and see that it accidentally falls into Susies hands! She decodes the message which says we DONT want her to go behind our house! Naturally shell go there and well be waiting ready to soak her with water balloons! Why dont we just hit her with water balloons right now where shes sitting? Youre a good officer Hobbes. But lets face it you dont have an executive mind. I still think my idea SORT of makes sense...
06/08/93
Now this is supposed to look like a coded message from me to you but well leave it for Susie to find. Obviously the code will have to be easy to break so she can read the disinformation were giving her. Who about if we write backwards? Yeah thats good! Dear Hobbes. Gosh I hope Susies not too dumb to figure this out. Cracking codes is second nature to cool spies like us.
07/08/93
TOP SECRET. DEAR HOBBES IF SUSIE GOES BEHIND OUR HOUSE AT NOON ALL OUR SECRET PLANS WILL BE RUINED! CALVIN. There! Once Susie decodes this message shell be lured to our water balloon trap! What a great plan! My only regret is blowing the best day of my life while Im so young.
08/08/93
Buttons... check. Dials... check. Switches... check. Little colored lights... check. Calvin the airline pilot is tenth in life for takeoff. His patience is at an end! Ignoring the control towers protests Calvin guns the engines and passes the other planes cutting across less crowded runways! Rounding a corner he opens the throttle! Stewardesses explaining the aircrafts safety features are hurled to the rear of the plane by the sudden acceleration! All the other planes watch with envy as Calvin takes off ahead of schedule! But what is this?! Another plane has already recieved clearance to land! Its headed for the same runway! It looks like a mid-air collission over a crowded super highway at rush hour! Oh what a price to pay for his hurry! Im back! Thanks for waiting so patiently. I could wait even longer if youd buy me a THIRD plane.
09/08/93
Good! Susies still playing on the sidewalk! Well stroll by and accidentally drop the coded message. Yes Hobbes I have a TOP SECRET CODED letter for you here! Verrrry mysterious! Verrry secret! Just make sure the note doesnt fall into a GIRLS hands! If the code is broken and read our plans will be ruined! We did it! Ha! Everything is going perfectly! ...Except shes not picking up the letter.
10/08/93
Why isnt Susie picking up the coded message?! Doesnt she SEE it?? Whats WRONG with her?! Doesnt she know enough to intercept somebody elses secret letter when its dropped right in front of her?? Maybe she wasnt paying attention to us. Thats inconceivable! Who wouldnt be interested in everything we do?!
11/08/93
Look! Susie sees the letter! Shes picking it up! Shes reading the envelope! ... shes walking over here... You dropped this letter for Hobbes. Here. Um... gee thanks. Well that was awfully decent of her. Its no use! Its no use! Everybody gets good enemies except ME!
12/08/93
Lets stroll over THIS way ONCE AGAIN Hobbes! Yes lets! Its a good think you have that TOP SECRET CODED letter Hobbes! It would be awful if you happened to DROP it near SUSIE one more time! If I were SUSIE and I FOUND THE LETTER Id PICK IT UP AND DECODE IT so I could RUIN ALL OUR PLANS! That would sure be BAD for US! It worked! Shes opening the letter! Good. I was afraid wed have to hit her on the head and read it to her.
13/08/93
This must be the coded letter Calvins trying to get me to read. Hmph not much of a code... just backward letters! I can read it through the back of the page. Dear Hobbes if Susie goes behind our house at noon all our secret plans will be ruined. Calvin. Gosh its almost noon! Id better hurry over to Calvins house if I want to spoil his plans! Wheee! Ha ha! She fell for it! Cmon Hobbes hurry!
14/08/93
Oh boy this is going to be great! Get the water balloons! Hurry! Weve got to hide before Susie gets here. Ha ha! She swallowed that fake letter hook line and sinker! She thinks shes tricking US but well trick HER! Were geniuses Hobbes! Hee hee! Man is she in for a surprise! I wonder whats keeping her. She probably got lost.
15/08/93
Calvin? Calvin? Calvin! Hmm... the engines making funny noises. Spaceman Spiff is going down over Planet Gork! Zounds! The planet is inhabited! An alien metropolis opens up before our heros eyes! Spiffs stabilizers refuse to respond! Our hero is going to crazh! THIS SPELLS DISASTER! CALVIN! ..uh... D... I... S... A... S... T... E... R. Very good. Im glad you were paying attention. YES! Once again the incredible Spaceman Spiff beats all odds to save the day! You may sit down Calvin.
16/08/93
Its past noon! Why isnt Susie walking into our brilliant ambush?! Where is she?! You stay here and guard the water balloons. Ill go on a reconnaissance mission and find out what shes doing. Wait a minute. Why cant I go on the reconnaissance mission? Because if you get captured youll tell Susie anything for a tummy rub. I MIGHT not!
17/08/93
You cant trust a girl to do anything right! We go to all this trouble to lure Susie into this trap and she doesnt shop up! As soon as I find out where she is Ill get Hobbes and the water balloons and well let her have it! If she wont come to the ambush well bring the ambush to her! Five... four... three... two...
18/08/93
AAUGGH! OH NO! AIEE! ACKPTH! BLUBPLUB PLPPTTB! This doesnt go in the club log understood? It never happened. Since youre already wet it would be a shame not to use these water balloons.
19/08/93
Its a dark day for the Get Rid Of Slimy girlS club. Our great plan backfired and IM the one who got soaked! Oh the shame! The ignominy! ...sighhhh... If you resign can I be dictator-for-life? I DIDNT SAY I WAS RESIGNING!
20/08/93
Well Hobbes the battle may have been lost but the war goes on! This afternoon well devise a bigger better and even more complicated scheme and revenge will be ours! The spirit of G.R.O.S.S.ness cannot be extinguished! ...and for courage in the face of setbacks I award us bottle caps of valor! Yayy! A good meeting always ends with us getting new medals! This is SUCH a great club!
21/08/93
Here Calvin I brought some lunch for you and Hobbes. Gee thanks Mom. What do you say we break out the comic books while we think up our big plans? Oh boy! Its looking like a good afternoon ol buddy. I love summer.
22/08/93
Uh oh. Here comes Susie. Try not to breathe in. Here Calvin. Whats this? Its an invtiation. Mr. Bun is hosting a milk and cookie party in ten minutes and you and Hobbes are invited. WE DECLINE! We wouldnt attend if you PAID us! Weve got better things to do than sit around with GIRLS and dumb toy animals! Fine! DONT come! Who cares? What a jerk. ...I went to all this trouble too. Dont be disappointed Mr. Bun. We can have a nice party all by ourselves. Phooey. Ha! We showed HER! All girls should be shipped to Pluto - thats what I say. I wonder what kind of cookies they were. YOU CAME! We dont ATTEND parties. We just CRASH em!
23/08/93
This is Dads idea of taking us to the beach.
24/08/93
Yep thats a pretty good cow impression. From now on thats how I eat salads.
25/08/93
All right heres a nickel. What do I get? Nothing. I just ripped you off. WHAT?! Thats life!
26/08/93
Oh Mom? I just remembered. Some lady called you about an hour ago. Did you get her name and number? No... Well how am I supposed to call her back?! You dont need to. Shes still on the line.
27/08/93
Nothing for me... nothing for me... Phooey. The mails here.
28/08/93
Yesterday Dad told me not to eat a pepper because it was hot ... so I ate the whole thing in two bites. Man was I ever in agony! I was ricocheting off the walls all night! I thought I was going to explode! I gotta get a stunt double.
29/08/93
Well! Peanut butter! ... or so it SEEMS. Did you see that? Hmm? What? My sandwich wiggled! Theres something ALIVE in it! Oh stop it Calvin. Im not kidding! Mom must be trying to kill me! I bet theres a slug in my peanut butter! Eww! Hmm... I dont FEEL any slugs in here. What could it be? Id better smell it. AUGH! AUGH! ITS GOT MY NOSE!! THE PEANUT BUTTER ITSELF IS ALIVE! ITS OOZING UP MY FACE! ITS GOING TO SUCK OUT MY EYEBALLS! HELP! RRGH! MMF! BLRGHGH! I got it off! Quick! Drown it in chocolate milk! Boy what a close call THAT was! Wont MOM be disappointed to see her little plot FAILED! Look at you! Ive never SEEN anything so revolting! Whats wrong with you?! Im eating somewhere else. Girls are so weird.
30/08/93
If I could just lead to ride that bicycle I could go all sorts of places. I could cover miles in no time at all! I could go anywhere! I could... AAAAAAAAA I could go to heaven. You? I doubt it.
31/08/93
OK bike listen up! I dont like you and you dont like me. But IVE got the tools to reduce you to piles of pipes sprockets and ball bearings! Do we understand each other? AAAAAAA. Maybe altogether too well.
01/09/93
Dad Will You Put A Bell On My Bike? I Think You Should Learn How To Ride Before You Worry About Having A Bell To Ring. Not THAT Kind Of Bell! I Want One Thatll Warn Me When The Darn Bikes Sneaking Up On Me!
02/09/93
I know why Dad got me that bike! Hes trying to bump me off! He knows the bike will stop at nothing to kill me. Dad figures pretty soon Ill have my head through a tree trunk and hell have some peace and quiet! IM on to him! I suppose thats easier than sending you to camp and moving. Well sure what if the house didnt sell?
03/09/93
That cloud does impressions!
04/09/93
Calvin would you set the table for me please? Mm... I dont think so. Im not enthusiastic about setting the table. I dont think you should have to do something unless youre enthusiastic about it.
05/09/93
OK I opened the door to your room. Now whats the big surprise? Uh... nothing. Try my closet.
06/09/93
I originally thought I was going to be a teen idol. Oh? Then I thought why wait until Im a teen-ager?! I want to be idolized NOW! Then you should probably blow your nose more regularly. Want an autographed 8x10 glossy?
07/09/93
Im a genius but Im a misunderstood genius. Whats misunderstood about you? Nobody thinks Im a genius.
08/09/93
At this room time enters a no-passing zone.
09/09/93
Let go of me ya big galoot! Why dont you pick on somebody your own size?! Theyd hit back. ...I guess that has a certain unethical logic to it...
10/09/93
Thats it! Im through learning today! See you all tomorrow! I think IM a better judge of when Im through.
11/09/93
Dad whats it like being a grown-up? Well its not too different from being a kid... ...except youre more attached to your toys.
12/09/93
Hows your math homework going? AUGH! FINE! ...sighhhh... RGHH! GRR YIPE! RGHH RRGH YIPE! YIPE! SNAP AIEE! EEK! EEK! SNAP SNAP CRUNCH URRPP YAA! AUGH! Your book ate your homework hmm? Thats a new one. Im lucky to be alive! I had to break its spine!
13/09/93
What a day. I feel like Ive been run over by a train. KAPOW! I mean NOW I feel like that. See? You should always save hyperbole until you really need it.
14/09/93
Today for show and tell I have an utterly amazing whistle! Ill demonstrate. TWEEEET. Whats so amazing about THAT?! It sounds like an ordinary whistle to ME! It can only be heard by ugly cretins. Ill get you at recess Calvin.
15/09/93
What if somebody calls us a pair o pathetic peripatetics? Ive never heard of anybody taking the trouble to rhyme weird insults. But shouldnt we have a ready retort?
16/09/93
Im doing a crossword puzzle. Number three across says Bird. Hmm... Ive got it! Yellow-bellied sapsucker! But there are only five boxes. I know. These idiots make you write real small.
17/09/93
Youre dead at recess Twinky. I feel sorry for you Moe. You must have some serious personal problems if this is how you relate to people. POW. Then again maybe hes just a world-class poop head.
18/09/93
OH NO! I OVERSLEPT! I GOTTA GET UP! But its Saturday. Well sure. If this was a school day what would I care?
19/09/93
Wow honey youre missing a beautiful sunset out here. Ill count to 10 and then... POW! Dad how come old photographs are always black and white? Didnt they have color film back then? Sure they did. In fact those old photographs ARE in color. Its just that the WORLD was black and white then. Really? Yep. The world didnt turn color until sometime in the 1930s and it was pretty grainy color for a while too. Thats really weird. Well truth is stranger than fiction. But then why are old PAINTINGS in color?! If the world was black and white wouldnt artists have painted it that way? Not necessarily. A lot of great artists were insane. But... but how could they have painted in color anyway? Wouldnt their paints have been shades of gray back then? Of course but they turned colors like everything else did in the 30s. So why didnt old black and white photos turn color too? Because they were color pictures of black and white remember? The world is a complicated place Hobbes. Whenever it seems that way I take a nap in a tree and wait for dinner.
20/09/93
Your new polls are in Dad. Mm. A vast majority of household six-year-olds say youre not living up to their expectations of fatherhood. What were their expectations? That youd be more like an automatic teller machine. Where do you pollsters find these respondents?
21/09/93
The more you know the harder it is to take decisive action. Once you become informed you start seeing complexities and shades of gray. You realize that nothing is as clear and simple as it first appears. Ultimately knowledge is paralyzing. Being a man of action I cant afford to take that risk. Youre ignorant. But at least you act on it.
22/09/93
Have you been reading about the electronic superhighway? Pretty soon computers telephones and TVs will all be hooked together to bring instantaneous interactive communication right into our homes! But Dad says he liked it better when you had to communicate by mail and you knew you wouldnt hear back from anybody for at least a week. Of course your Dad thinks transportation shouldve stopped with the bicycle. Im a 21st century kid trapped in a 19th century family.
23/09/93
Wait! Dont hit me! Theres something on your back! Im sure. Im serious! Its a note! Your Mom mustve pinned it on your shirt. Whats it say? It says Somebody run this boy over with a truck. If Im going to get clobbered I like to deserve it.
24/09/93
My watch tells the time the day and the date. It doesnt tell what month it is though. I need a watch that tells the month. I suppose they figure if you dont know what month it is youre not the type whod wear a watch.
25/09/93
Mom wants to know if wed like to go to the zoo today. Can we tour a prison afterward? No thanks.
26/09/93
Ive been thinking Hobbes. On a weekend? Well it wasnt on purpose... I believe history is a force. Its unalterable tide sweeps all people and institutions along its unrelenting path. Everything and everyone serves historys single purpose. And what is that purpose? Why to produce ME of course! Im the end result of history. YOU? Think of it! Thousands of generations lived and died to produce my exact specific parents whose reason for being obviously was to produce ME. All history up to this point has been spent preparing the world for my presence. Hmm 4.5 billion years probably wasnt long enough. Now Im here and history is vindicated. So now that historys brought you what are you going to do? Ooh you wascawwy wabbit!
27/09/93
Psst Susie! Whats the answer to question two? Eli Whitney and the cotton gin. But this is a math problem. Its a trick question. How come YOU wrote something different? Im going to get this question wrong so it wont look like you copied. Wow thanks! Oh I ow it to you.
28/09/93
OK thats how well do kickoffs. Go with what works I guess.
29/09/93
Ooh wook at da big stwipey putty! Is oo a fuzzy fwiendwy putty?? Tigers dont like to be called putties.
30/09/93
If heaven is good and if I like to be bad how am I supposed to be happy there? How will you get to heaven if you like to be bad? Lets say I didnt DO what I WANTED to do. Suppose I led a blameless life! Suppose I denied my true dark nature! Im not sure I have that much imagination. Maybe heaven is a place where youre ALLOWED to be bad!
01/10/93
Calvin your test was an absolute disgrace! Its obvious you havent read any of the material. Our first President was NOT Chef Boy-Ar-Dee and you ought to be ashamed to have turned in such preposterous answers! I just dont test well.
02/10/93
Look Hobbes! If you dry your teeth you can curl your upper lip and it will stick! See? Then you take a piece of tape... ...and use it to pull your nostrils up! Cool huh? Wow! Ill be if you showed your Dad hed go to work like that! YEAH!
03/10/93
Thats our son! *sighhhh* These pictures will remind us of more than we want to remember.
04/10/93
I love my school books. Just think! Pretty soon well have read ALL of this! I like to read ahead and see what were going to learn next. Its so exciting to know stuff. Having a book is like having a good friend with you. If you flip the pages of MY book an animated T.Rex drives the batmobile and explodes! Sometimes I think books are the only friends worth having.
05/10/93
I dont need to study! I dont need to learn! I can always get by on my good looks and charm! I dont hear you concurring hairball breath. Tell me is it static electricity that makes your hair do that?
06/10/93
I got a smiley face sticker on my quiz. Whoop-de-doo for you. What did YOU get? None of your darn business! You got a frowny face didnt you? NO as a matter of fact I didnt! I didnt even know they MADE barfing face stickers.
07/10/93
Miss Wormwood Im not going to learn this material unless you make it enthralling. I see. And what will you do if the rest of your life doesnt entertain you every minute? What ... you think Ill live in someplace that doesnt get cable?!
08/10/93
Love the sinner and hate the sin. Uh oh...
09/10/93
Hey nice moustache! Thanks. I made it. Very bushy. What did you use for the hair?
10/10/93
Why do animals always walk in circles before they lie down? Sorry. Privileged information. Z Psst! Hey kid! MONSTERS! What do you want? Theres a big shiny toy for you under the bed. Come get it! Oh sure! You just want me to come there so you can grab me with some oozing appendage slowly paralyze me with some vile secretion and devour me alive! Nice try! Forget it! Stupid monsters. All fangs and no brains. Psst! Tiger! Well give you some salmon if you push the kid over the bed! Is the salmon fresh? Hold on Ill check. Yeah its fresh. HOBBES DONT LISTEN TO THEM!!
11/10/93
Nowadays ads dont just sell a product. They sell an attitude! Look at this one! Heres a cool guy saying nobody tells him what to do. He does whatever he wants and he buys this product as a reflection of that independence. So basically this maverick is urging everyone to express his individuality through conformity in brand-name selection? Well it sounded more defiant the way HE said it. Mm.
12/10/93
Heres another ad with attitude. This guy didnt like his job so he quit and now he climbs rocks! See hes his own man! He grabs life by the throat and lives on his own terms! If he quit his job I wonder how he affords those expensive athletic shoes hes advertising. Maybe his Mom bought them for him. I hope shell pay his medical bills when he falls off that rock.
13/10/93
OW!! Mmf! Ngghh! Rrrrggg! FWOPP.
14/10/93
IM SIGNIFICANT! Screamed the dust speck.
15/10/93
The days are getting colder. Yes. BUGS ARE DYING BY THE TRUCKLOAD! HA HA HA! GOOD RIDDANCE TO EM ALL! I like fall.
16/10/93
Made in Gods own image yes sir! God must have a goofy sense of humor.
17/10/93
Eeesh. What goes down must come up. BLECHH! AGKH HEY! NO! DONT SPLOOSH HACK COUGH SPLUTTER MMF BLORP! UGH ICKK PTOOY YAA! ILL GET YOU!! Heh heh... Hello local navy recruitment office? Yes this is an emergency...
18/10/93
Another touchdown for me! Couldnt you chase me toward the other goal for once?
19/10/93
See? SEE?? I DID hang up my coat! Its right there just like I said! I was right and you were wrong. OK OK Im sorry. Forgive me. Heh heh heh! Another tally mark for today. You dont need to keep score!
20/10/93
Everybody seeks happiness! Not ME though! Thats the difference between me and the rest of the world! Happiness isnt good enough for me! I demand euphoria! The problem with you Hobbes is youre always at a loss for words. Ive found that saves many a friendship.
21/10/93
Here I am happy and content. ...but not euphoric. So now Im no longer content. Im unhappy. My day is ruined. I need to stop thinking while Im ahead.
22/10/93
Is hamburger meat made out of people from Hamburg? Of course not! Its ground beef. Im eating a COW? Right. I dont think I can finish this.
23/10/93
Did you see where it landed? Look for the crater. Are we a little scared of the ball?
24/10/93
Thank you Claire. That was very good. ... all right whod like to go next? Anyone at all besides Calvin? HEY! For show-and-tell I brought these amazing fossilized bone fragments that I painstakingly unearthed from sedimentary deposits in my front yard! Though they look like ordinary driveway gravel to the untotured eyes of the ignorant layman I immediately recognized these as pieces of jawbone from a new species of carnosaur! In this dramatic illustration Ive re-created the complete Calvinosaurus as it would have appeared in the late Jurassic! Its coloration here is somewhat conjectural. Ill be publishing my full findings shortly! Undoubtedly Ill be the recipient of many lucrative paleontology prizes and in a matter of weeks prestige fame and fortune will be mine! When this happens you can be darn sure that those of you who were mean to me in school will suffer appropriately! Ill employ my resources to make your puny lives miserable! Ill crush your pitiful dreams and ambitions like bugs in the dust! ... but there IS an alternative! Im now accepting a limited number of applications to be my pal. The cost is just $20 per person and you can revel in the association for a lifetyme! Any takers? Oh yeah? Just you wait!
25/10/93
Hold it Moe! Before you wallop me Im afraid youll have to sign this form. Whats this? Its a statement acknowledging responsibility for your behavior. You agree that hitting me entitles me to unlimited compensation for medical treatment as well as reasonable damages for pain and suffering. You affirm that youre insured for these costs and... Nobody takes responsibility for his actions any more.
26/10/93
Here Dad. Id like you to sign this form and have it notarized. I the undersigned Dad attest that I have never parented before and insofar as I have no experience in the job ... ...I am liable for my mistakes and I agree to pay for any counseling in perpetuity Calvin may require as a result of my parental ineptitude. I dont see how youre allowed to have a kid without signing one of those.
27/10/93
Miss Wormwood Id like you to sign this contract. Its an agreement that youll compensate me for any loss of job income I may suffer as an adult because of a poor first-grade eduction. If you get a poor first-grade education it will be from YOUR lack of effort not mine. Go back to your desk. By golly SOMEBODY ought to may me if I dont learn anything.
28/10/93
Hi Susie! Would you sign this legal document? What is it? In essence it annuls our knowledge of each others existence and it prohibits any future social interaction. Specifically it states that Ill never ask you out on a date and it imposes severe penalties on any party that attempts to engage the other in conversa... Its almost insulting how fast she signed that.
29/10/93
Here Hobbes. Ive drawn up a friendship contract for you to sign. A contract? Right. It codifies the terms of our friendship. You can renegotiate in 20 years. People are friends because they WANT to be not because they HAVE to be! Thats what this fixes. If your friends are contractual you dont have any.
30/10/93
Dad why do my eyes shut when I sneeze? If your lids werent closed the force of the explosion would blow your eyeballs out and stretch the optic nerve so your eyes would float around and youd have to point them with your hands to see anything. Gross. How come you know so much? Its all in the book you get when you become a father.
31/10/93
The end of the mesozoic era... a herd of chasmosaurs is unusually jittery! They now know they have more to fear than tyrannosaurs! Now they face an even GREATER danger... TYRANNOSAURS in F-14s! This is SO cool! This is SO stupid!
01/11/93
You say when you become a father you get a book that explains everything in the world? Right. Can I se it? Nope sorry. Why not? It tells what its like to raise a kid. SO?! Youre not allowed to know that until its too late not to have one.
02/11/93
AAAAAA! A person should be safe from predators inside his own house! If I had reflexes like yours Id be glad for the opportunity to improve them.
03/11/93
HEY LOOK AT ME! Nude descending a staircase! Nobody understands art.
04/11/93
...sighh... They say nobody lies on his deathbed wishing hed spent more time at the office. Well Id better get to the office. That was obviously some sort of commentary.
05/11/93
Doggone it hes got all the covers again. Zz. Zz... hmm? Oh yes Im VERY fond of Calvin. ...pass the gravy please. zzz. Brrr... Zz.
06/11/93
Why should I take a bath? Im just going to get dirty again. Why should I brush my teeth? Im just going to eat again. Why should I comb my hair? Its just going to get messed up again. Id rather be efficient than hygienic.
07/11/93
Im bored. Lets go in. But weve only been out here a few minutes. This is taking too long. Whats the hurry? Weve got all day! Yeah but its kind of cold and the suns too bright and my gloves are getting wet. And when you think about it building a snowman is a lot of work. I didnt come here to do something hard. Besides what if the snowman doesnt come out very good? Wed be failures! Who wants to be a failure?! Or even if its good whats the point? Its just going to melt in a few weeks anyway! Its all futile! So instead of wasting my time Im going to go inside pull down the shades and watch TV. That way in complete physical comfort I can vicariously experience the activity of actors pretending to do things! Are you sure its not too much trouble to turn on the TV? Thats why we have a remote control. Virtual reality is already here. I cant believe the only way to get inside is by WALKING.
08/11/93
Hi its me your big accomplishment in life! Im depressed.
09/11/93
Did you check the pockets of my pants before you washed them? Yes. Did you find anything... um... surprising? Like what? Lets just say we need some big gloves and a heavy stick... FAST. Do you mean you dont know where this thing IS?!
10/11/93
Oh no! Mom packed me a piece of PIE in my lunch! She hates me! I refuse to eat it! You dont like pie? Not this kind. What kind is it? Cow pie. MISS WORMWOOD! Want it? Its fresh.
11/11/93
I wish I had a heavier coat. Theatrics notwithstanding the thermostat stays where it is.
12/11/93
... and so in 1654... HKGHHKKGHH. Mysterious planet Zartok-3 appears from... KHGHHKGGH. PAY ATTENTION! When you change the channel I dont think the original program should be able to change it back.
13/11/93
Mom what was I like as a baby? Stinky. Stinky?? Stinky. Its always shocking to see ones existence reduced to a blurb.
14/11/93
Brrrr! Im freezing! You need a nice fur coat like mine. Im all toasty. Ill just put my feed on your back OK? Ooh you ARE warm! GAAA! Quit thrashing around! Youre letting in cold air! Well keep your icy feet on your own side of the bed then! They WERE! Your big behind was on MY side! THATs your side! THIS is the demilitarized zone and THIS is MY side! All THAT?! No way you hog! In fact the whole bed is my side! Animals should sleep on the floor! Oh THAT does it! You and your hairless pink monkey suit can freeze solid! Im leaving! HEY! Dont take the blanket! COME BACK HERE! ILL GET YOU! GIMME THAT! ...now whered he go?? AAAAAA GAAAA! SOMEBODYS FEET ARE LIKE ICE!! Calvin had another nightmare. If its two crowded you guys are welcome to sleep downstairs.
15/11/93
I need some help with my homework Hobbes. Whats the assignment? Im supposed to write a paper that presents both sides of an issue and then defends one of the arguments. Whats your issue? Thats the problem. I cant think of anything to argue. Thats hard to believe. Im always right and everybody else is always wrong! Whats to argue about?!
16/11/93
Help me think of an issue to debate for this dumb paper. Well what issues do you care about? I dont care about issues! Ive got better things to do than argue with every wrong-headed crackpot with an ignorant opinion! Im a busy man! I say either agree with me or take a hike! Im right period! End of discussion! Um... right. There see? Everybodys happy.
17/11/93
So what am I going to write about? Hmm... well need to put on our thinking caps. HEY! Thinking caps! THATS what we need! Cmon! This is a GREAT idea! Boy where would I be without you? Conceivably you might be working on your assignment.
18/11/93
Well use this colander for the thinking cap! Its metal surface can conduct electrical brain impulses and reflect brain waves! Next well need to attach those input and output strings and a grounding string. Why a grounding string? Its like a lightning rod for brainstorms... I want to keep my ideas grounded in reality. I think youre too late. Well also need to build a transformer for the atomic cerebral enhance-o-tron.
19/11/93
The thinking cap is all set! Lets turn it on! Click. Brzap. Did it work? I think so. I feel smarter already.
20/11/93
What happened to your head?? Evidently an unanticipated physiological consequence of cerebral augmentation. My brain swelled. If your hats dont fit will you give them to me? My powerful brain is unraveling the mysteries of the universe. Its amazing! All natural laws can be reduced to one simple unifying equation! Really? What is it? Already my powerful brain is bored with such simple problems and is now working on why girls are so obnoxious.
21/11/93
Sighhh... I wish I could go to the moon. I wish I could too. Dear...
22/11/93
Now that the thinking cap has enlarged your brain you can write your homework paper. I concur. CALVIN DINNER TIME. Uh oh. Wait until your parents see your head! I am applying my powerful brain to the dilemma. I know! Well wrap my head in this bedsheet! THAT will allay any suspicion! Your powerful brain must know something I dont.
23/11/93
Calvin come down for dinner! Im not calling you again! Hurry up with the turban! There. Sorry Im late. I was unavoidably detained. Calvin we dont eat at the table looking like that. Take off the sheet. Uh... heh heh... um... Thank you. I dont know why I worry. They never notice anything.
24/11/93
I brought you some fish from dinner. Obviously I dont need to eat brain food now. Oh boy. OK lets get down to business. Ill apply my powerful brain to the problem of my homework. ...hmmmmmm... Hows it going? Good! I just remembered what the assignment was.
25/11/93
My powerful brain has come up with a topic for my paper. Great. Ill write about the debate over tyrannosaurs. Were they fearsome predators or disgusting scavengers? Which side will you defend? Oh I believe they were fearsome predators definitely. How come? Theyre SO much cooler that way.
26/11/93
Lets see... to argue that tyrannosaurs were predators and not scavengers well need to write a brief overview of carnosaur evolution. Then well delve into skeletal structure skull design arm strength potential running speed and environmental factors. ...but first well draw some pictures of a T.Rex eating people in the natural history museum. I notice your head is shrinking back to normal size.
27/11/93
Your forehead is back to normal. The brain enhancement must have worn off. But you havent written your paper yet. Oh thats the easy part. The HARD part was getting a topic and making these funny drawings. Now all I have to do is write everything I know about tyrannosaurs. Itll be a breeze. For once Im GUARANTEED a good grade! CALVIN TIME FOR BED.
28/11/93
This sculpture will be called The spirit of compromise. Well each make a snowman and have them shanking hands. This will be very insprational! People will weep to see two snowmen overcoming their differences and cooperating! Soon well be rolling in public commissions! Make your snowmans arm longer. His hand wont reach my snowmans hand. Why should I make a new arm? Just make YOURS longer. Then it will look like my snowman had to reach farther than yours did. They should be equal. Then build your snowman closer over here! Im not going to start all over! Just make your arm longer! I refuse. You cant tell me what to do! In that case my snowman refuses to shake with your snowman! So what?? My snowman wont even TALK to yours! Im turning his head the other way! Ha! While hes looking over there MY snowman will kick YOUR snowman in his big white butt! Oh yeah well mine knocks your snowmans head off! Fine! My snowman feeds your snowman his own nose! Why you...!! Leggo OW OOF Stop it! I dont think this sculpture is very good. Its a compromise.
29/11/93
TIME FOR BED?? Thats what I said. But I havent finished my paper for school yet! I need more time! How much more do you have to do? I just have to write it.
30/11/93
You mean its bedtime and you havent even started writing your paper for school?! What have you been DOING all evening?? Well first Hobbes and I invented and constructed a thinking cap that augmented my brain so I could think up a good topic and then we drew illustrations of... That doesnt sound like a very good time budget to me. I wasnt expecting to get audited so soon.
01/12/93
Great! Just great! Mom lets us stay up for half an hour longer to finish this paper. How am I supposed to do a good job in so little time?! Your Mom says you wasted the whole evening. But now shes making me do a rushed slipshod job! Ill have to compromise the qualitY! I wont get the A I deserve! Especially since youve used up 15 minutes complaining about it. Itll tell the teacher its Moms fault.
02/12/93
What a rotten evening that was. At least you finished your paper. Yeah but it couldve been a lot better. I finally get a chance to write about something I know backward and forward and I have to rush the whole thing. Well with the time available you did the best you could. ...sort of. I think geniuses should be given special considerations.
03/12/93
My paper is entitled Tyrannosaurus Rex: Fearson Predator or Loathsome Scavenger? Ahem... I say tyrannosaurs were predators because it would be so bogus if they just ate things that were already dead. The end. IM A CONCISE WRITER OK?!?
04/12/93
Miss Wormwood was going to give me a D- on my paper but I talked to her after class and told her how I ran out of time and couldnt write all I knew about tyrannosaurs. She said Id had plenty of time to do the assignment but she admitted that maybe Id picked too complex a subject. So she raised my grade to a D and told me I should try to pick realistic goals and plan my time better. I guess we learned a lesson huh? Ill say. Smooth-talking the teacher really pays off!
05/12/93
Thats strange. I dont remember a door being here before. Heres your breakfast! M-MOM?? Eat up! Mmm! It looks yummy! Y-YOURE NOT MY MOM! Yes I am! Eat your oatmeal! Whats going on? This isnt my house an dyoure not my Mom!! Oh no! Thats not our yard outside! Its a CAGE! NAUGH!! Im trapped in a lab and theyre trying to get me to imprint on my own species before they return me to the wild! Hes on to us Wayne. There goes our funding. Heres your breakfast. Whats the matter? Prove youre my Mom.
06/12/93
14... 52... POW! WAAUGH! YOURE SUPPOSED TO WAIT UNTIL I HIKE THE BALL!! Oops. Sorry. Darn tigers. You can explain the rules to em but you cant suppress their surprise pounce instinct.
07/12/93
Yesterday Dad went to buy a hardcover novel. He said he wanted to read something long rich and thought-provoking for a change and he wanted a cloth binding so his book could be carried around and reread later. Then he said he was going to buy the book with cash so nobody could trace the purchase to him and exploit his interest for commercial purposes. You Dads going into the guture kicking and screaming isnt he? What if hes turning me into some kind of subversive?
08/12/93
Mom can I get a big tattoo? I want a winged serpent coiling around one arm clutching a ship on my chest with... ...um... I mean... ...well... ...sighhhh... Did you know Mom can communicate telepathically?
09/12/93
Im gonna pound you at recess Twinky. Youd better be nice to me Moe. Haw! Why? Because someday my tax dollars will be paying for your prison cell. POW! My whole problem is my lips move when I think.
10/12/93
You know everything I am... my unique spirit and personality... everything that makes me ME... ...is dependent on the proper functioning of this complex fagile and miraculous chunk of meat that is my body. Interesting observation. Well it just occurred to me. WAHOOOOOOO.
11/12/93
They say the world is a stage. But obviously the play in unrehearsed and everybody is ad-libbing his lines. Maybe thats why its hard to tell if were in a tragedy or a farce. We need more special effects and dance numbers.
12/12/93
POW! SMACK!
13/12/93
Yep Christmas is just around the corner. And what better way to celebrate a religious holiday than with a month of frenzied consumerism! Im surprised other religions havent picked up on that. Getting loads of loot is a very spiritual experience for me.
14/12/93
Dear Santa Every year at this time I send you a list of what I want for Christmas. And every year you callously ignore it and bring me practical things I dont want at all. Whats the deal?! Are you insane? Have you gone senile?? Cant you read?? Or are you just a vindictive twisted elf bent on destroying kids dreams?!?! You might want to sleep on this one. I know but it felt good to write it.
15/12/93
Dear Santa Last year I did not receive the 15000 items I requested for Christmas. I can only conclude that your secretarial staff must be a bunch of underpaid and woefully unprepared temps and my letter was misfiled. To avoid a similar disaster this year just write me a check for five million dollars and Ill buy the stuff myself. See THIS year I wont be disappointed. Id leave out the part about the temps.
16/12/93
Dear Santa Hello I am Calvins new baby brother Melville. Enclosed is a list of what I want for Christmas. Please dont confuse MY list with Calvins. There are TWO kids at this house now. Man if Santa falls for this Ill add a new brother every year! Melville?
17/12/93
No snow. ...which means I cant paste anyone with a snowball... which means Im good... which means Ill get lots of Christmas presents! Ha! Nothing in life is ever easy.
18/12/93
Look at all this snow! Im being tested. We got this snow so Id be tempted to smack Susie with a slushball and forfeit all my Christmas presents. To evaluate my chatacter my immediate pleasure is being pitted against my future greed! Poor Susie. ITS NOT A FOREGONE CONCLUSION!
19/12/93
There. Now we need to get this on the roof. SANTA --- WEIGHTED DOWN WITH EXTRA TOYS? DROP EM OFF HERE! --- CALVIN. Ive been thinking. They say Santa knows if youve been bad or good right? Right. But think how many kids there are in the whole world! Nobody could be watching every kid every single minute! I mean Santas OLD! He probably takes naps! THe way I figure it Santa must just make a few random checks on us once or twice a week. Thats all? Sure. Hed catch enough bad kids that way to scare everyone else into being good most of the time. Hed create the impression hes watching more than he really is! Pretty shrewd. Yeah but now that Im on to him Im going to smack Susie with a snowball! If I do it quick the odds of Santa watching me at that exact moment are virtually nil! What if Susie tells on you? Ooh I didnt think of that! Shes a girl so she probably WOULD snitch! Phoeey. Well I sure hope Santas watching now seeing as Im being so good. Unwillingly good but good nonetheless.
20/12/93
The day after Christmas is going to be epic.
21/12/93
Throwing these snowballs would give me immediate and certain pleasure. Refraining from throwing these snowballs in the hope of being rewarded at Christmas is delayed and Uncertain pleasure. As usual goodness hardly puts up a fight.
22/12/93
What if there is no Santa Claus? You know a lot of this Santa stuff is hard to believe. The flying reindeer going around the world in one night the whole chimney bit... What if its all some cruel hoax and Im being good for NOTHING? Youve ALWAYS been good for nothing! If he exists Santa will forgive this one.
23/12/93
Im not bad. Im just... um... ...exuberant! Theres nothing wrong with being exuberant! Heads up! POW! Go on explain the semantics to your Mom. Yikes she got her wind back and shes gaining!
24/12/93
Piff. SANTAS GONNA SKIP YOUR HOUSE FOR THAT CALVIN! I figure this doesnt really count against me since shes so sanctimonious and I keep missing.
25/12/93
HA HA! ACQUITTAL ON ALL CHARGES! COMPLETE EXONERATION! HA HA HA! Merry Christmas to you too dear. Phew whats that smell? Has someone been eating tuna fish at this horrible hour?!
26/12/93
I asked Dad if he wanted to see some new years resolutions I wrote. He said hed be glad to and he was pleased to see I was taking an interest in self-improvement. I told him the resolutions werent for ME they were for HIM. Thats why were outside now. I WONDERED what the rush was. Im getting disillusioned with these new years. They dont seem very new at all! Each new year is just like the old year! Here another year has gone by and everythings still the same! Theres still pollution and war and stupidity and greed! Things havent changed! I say what kind of future IS this?! I thought things were supposed to improve! I thought the future was supposed to be better! The problem with the future is that it keeps turning into the present.
27/12/93
Z. Y-YAWNN. Theres no sedative like seeing a tiger lying in the sun.
28/12/93
Hey Dad why dont you cut down all the trees in our hill and put in a ski lift? Because a ski lift would be ugly noisy and completely unnecessary. The problem with Dad is he doesnt know progress when he hears it.
29/12/93
AAUGHH. I meant to do that. Then it worked very well.
30/12/93
Ive lost my marbles. Everyone suspected as much. Well I hope somebody finds them again. HEY!!
31/12/93
I need a new toboggan. What for? Mine is outdated. Im sure the 94 models have all sorts of new features colors and options. Toboggans dont come in model years. They dont?? I tell you Hobbes theres a fortune to be made!
01/01/94
What the...?? Im not playing with a full deck! Thats what some people say. Really? Then why didnt somebody go buy some new cards?! HEY!!
02/01/94
Ready? OFF WE GO-O!! WEEEEE AAAAAA WHOAAAA OOH AH EE ACK OW WAAUGH! OOMFF UGH HOOF HUHH YAAAAAA WO WO WO WO WO unggg. I think that was our best ride EVER! I kept closing my eyes. Lets do it again.
03/01/94
I resent the quality of network programming! Its all fluff violence sensationalism and sleaze! I hunger for serious tasteful entertainment that respects my intelligence! So turn off the stupid TV and read a book. All right I lied. Sue me.
04/01/94
Why does he have a hot water bottle on his head? Hes committing suicide.
05/01/94
Ill take one card. OK. I fold. Are you cheating?!
06/01/94
Incredibly people NEVER expect to get hit with a snowball in the house. Ill see you in your room momentarily.
07/01/94
If anyone hits me with a snowball Ill hit HIM with 250 snowballs! What if somebody hits YOU with 250 snowballs? ...sighhh...
08/01/94
This will by my strongest fort ever! With these massive walls Ill be safe from any attack! HELLLP!!
09/01/94
YAWNN... Im going to get some coffee Ted. Want any? No thanks Frank. Tum te ta ta tum... BLAM! GAKK AIEEE!! They got Frank!! RUN. You got im! Hes a big one too! Nice shot Bamb. Somebody get the camera! ... needless to say Franks family was upset when he didnt come home that night but everybody understood that the human population had doubled in just two generations to almost six billion so some thinning of the herds was necessary to prevent starvation. Another parent-teacher conference. Your turn.
10/01/94
I dont think the schools assign enough homework.
11/01/94
Some kids at school got filthy rich today. Really? How? They grabbed him by the drinking fountain.
12/01/94
Here youll probably want this pillow. What for? Its like an air bag. Hold it in front of your head like this as we go down. Dont you feel safer now? I certainly do.
13/01/94
Yes! POW. Wasnt that a great shot?? What control! What form! Did you notice the top spin? Did you notice how I packed the snow so that... A REAL friend wouldve been happy for me!
14/01/94
Some people complain all the time! They complain about the least little thing! If something bugs them they never let go of it! They just go on and on long after anyone else is interested! Its just complain complain complain! People who gripe all the time really drive me nuts! Youd think theyd change the subject after a while but they never do! They just keep griping until you start to wonder Whats wrong with this idiout? But they go on complaining and repeating what theyve already said! Maybe theyre not very self-aware. Boy thats ANOTHER thing that gets on my nerves!
15/01/94
We need more extension cords.
16/01/94
The courageous Spaceman Spiff interplanetary explorer extraordinaire lands on yet another bizarre planet! Setting his death ray blaster on frappe our hero sets off in search of alien weirdness! Zounds! A mysterious mist materializes out of nowhere! The fearless Spiff cant see a thing! ... so we add two to four... OUR HERES IN A TOTAL FOG! The atmosphere here is a... a... p-powerful se... se... sedative! Spiff cant keep his eyes o... open. KLUNK zzzzz. Our hero suddenly comes to!
17/01/94
OK these are my footprints. Here I stop hear something and start to turn around. A few feet farther on theres the impression of my body as I hit the ground. These are the powdered remains of the snowball that hit me. From the angle of particle dispersement we can tell the snowball was thrown from over here where we find... ...tiger tracks. Those could by ANYBODYs tiger tracks.
18/01/94
POW! I must say the stinging snow makes your cheeks look positively radiant. Some people sure cant take a compliment.
19/01/94
Shrimp.
20/01/94
Circumstantial evidence thats all youve got! You cant get a fair trial in this town.
21/01/94
I couldnt stand being a girl. I cant stand you either way. When guys grow up they get to play with cards sports equipment cameras stereos electric tools... you name it. But girls dont get any toys when they grow up. Women just buy clothes and shoes. How boring. How sad. I guess girls actually mature as they get older. I cant wait until Im old enough to putter around.
22/01/94
On the other hand the neighbors keep planting nice been trees next to us.
23/01/94
munch munch WHUNK! GAAAA!! GRRRRRRRR OOMF! munch munch. Im still hungry. I fixed you a nice lunch. You can wait until dinner.
24/01/94
Our lives are filled with machines designed to reduce work and increase leisure. We have more leisure than any man has ever had. And what do we do with this leisure? Educate ourselves? Take up new interests? Explore? Invent? Create? Dad I cant hear this commercial. If it were up to Dad leisure would be as bad as work.
25/01/94
I KNOW I have hat hair so you dont need to tell me. Actually its not that different.
26/01/94
See? if you jump right you dont need to waste time shoveling the entire walk.
27/01/94
Test: 1. When did the pilgrims land at Plymouth Rock? 1620. As you can see Ive memorized this utterly useless fact long enough to pass a test question. I now intend to forget it forever. Youve taught me nothing except how to cynically manipulate the system. Congratulations. They say the satisfaction of teaching makes up for the lousy pay.
28/01/94
2. Where is Plymouth Rock? I am not presently at liberty to divulge that information as it might compromise our agents in the field. I understand my tests are popular reading in the teachers lounge.
29/01/94
Gimme a quarter Twinky. Your simian countenance unusually rich in species diversity. What? Here you go. That was worth 25 cents.
30/01/94
Hey theres some sort of remote control gizmo in this drawer. I wonder what it does. Click. WAAA! Mom?? Dad??? CALVIN! SIGHHH. Calvin thats very annoying.
31/01/94
Why is it that I can recall a cigarette ad jingle from 25 years ago but I cant remember what I just got up to do?
01/02/94
Eep! scritch scritch scritch scritch . You know Mom blames ME for scuffing up the floor. I wish your parents would take out these floor boards and put down some sod.

Look Mom I made you some subtitles. Hmm? When youre talking to me you choose the appropriate card to translate what youre saying and prop it against your feet for me to read. For example if you say Go to bed NOW you can use this card which says Youve got ten minutes until I blow my stack. See? Then Ill know what you mean. I dont need translation! Ive even got subtitles for parentisms like Youre going to poke somebodys eye out with that.
03/02/94
Why are you following me around? Why are you following me around? And why are you repeating what I say? And why are you repeating what I say? If youre going to keep doing that I just wont say anything. If youre going to keep doing that I just wont say anything. The incredibly annoying human echo strikes again!
04/02/94
Stop repeating everything I say.Stop repeating everything I say.Quit it. Quit it. Im an ugly little maggot with lumpy gravy for brains! At least you have the courage to admit it. Sooner or later everyone falls for that.
05/02/94
How much longer are you going to repeat whatever I say? How much longer are you going to repeat whatever I say? OK then just keep at it Mr Annoying Human Echo. OK then just keep at it Mr Annoying Human Echo. We can a priori and prior to all given objects have a knowledge of those conditions on which alone experience of them is possible but never of the laws to which things may in themselves be subject without reference to possible experience. We can ah peoria and ...um... snow down what? Hold on. Thbbpbptt! Cheater.
06/02/94
OOMF! Cat nap noun: a quick light doze in the manner of cats. I KNOW what it means!
07/02/94
Youll never get ahead by lying around you know? Who are we racing? Obviously were... um... well... uh... Im too busy to explain this stuff! Ive got important work to do! VERY important! Let me know if you win.
08/02/94
Oh yeah? Oh YEAH?? Well remember what you said because in a day or two Ill have a witty and blistering retort! Youll be devastated THEN I promise! Hmph. I wish I could think of comeback lines on the spot.
09/02/94
Your whiskers are too unruly. You should wax them and make a handlebar mustache. AAAAAAAAAAAAA. Youd think a guy who cleans humself with his tongue would be open to grooming suggestions.
10/02/94
Heres the latest poll on your performance as Dad. Your approval rating is pretty low Im afraid. Thats because theres not necessarily any connection between whats good and whats popular. I do whats right not what gets approval. Youll never kep the job with THAT attitude. If someone else offers to do it let me know.
11/02/94
Test: 1. What important event took place on December 16 1773? I do not believe in linear time. There is no past and future: all is one and existence in the temporal sense is illusory. This question therefore is meaningless and impossible to answer. When in doubt deny all terms and definitions.
12/02/94
YAAAAA. RRRRRR. OK its harder than it looks. Goodness how did you guys ever live long enough to invent tools?
13/02/94
The secret to enjoying your job is to have a hobby thats even worse.
14/02/94
I wish I had amazing super powers. If you work and study real hard for years and years you could develop the powers you already have. Maybe I can find a radioactive meteorite that mutates me into a living liquid. Try to find one that mutates you into someone with a work ethic.
15/02/94
Mom and Dad dont value hard work and originality as much as they say they do.
16/02/94
DING DONG. Heh heh heh. Oh! Oop! ...um... Hi Mrs. Derkins. I was hoping Susie would answer the ...uh... I mean um Im selling huge snowballs. Would you like to buy one? My Plan As are great but my Plan Bs leave a lot to be desired.
17/02/94
POW! LOOK OUT! My snowballs go faster than the speed of sound. They do not you big liar!
18/02/94
I wish this sled had a speedometer so we could know how fast were going. I suppose we could measure the hill time our descent calculate our rate in feet per minute and convert that into miles per hour. That sounds like math. Um yes. Suddenly I stopped caring.
19/02/94
Whats THIS snowman? Hes a paleontologist. Hes looking for cretaceous snow dinosaurs. Why does he look so sad? He realized that snow doesnt fissilize. It just melts. Your nowmen lead tragic lives. Well theyre not very bright.
20/02/94
Get going or youll miss the school bus. Uh... greetings. My name is Calvin. POOF. Grittings. Ma name is Kahlfin. Grittings. Ma nam is Kahlfin. Um... yes! Well Calvin heres your lunchbox. Have a good day at school. Hoffa gud tay. Lunboks. Hi Calvin. Grittings. Ma nam is Kahlfin. Heeryor lunkboks. Hoffa gut tay askool. Calvins principal says to say hello. Huh boy. It troo! Dat darn Kahlfun stole ma spacechip!
21/02/94
CALVIN IM LATE FOR WORK!
22/02/94
How much is that tiger in the window? The one who does nothing but sleep? Well spread him out flat in the rec room and have a new rug if hes cheap!
23/02/94
Yes Calvin? Why arent you teaching us the gender of nouns? Is desk masculine? Is chair feminine? Foreign kids know but WE dont! No wonder we cant compete in a global market! I demand sex education. ...I wonder if her doctor knows she mixes all those medications.
24/02/94
YAWWW. Trifle not with tired tigers.
25/02/94
I bet I can knock Dads hat off with this snowball. I bet you cant/. Oh yeah?! How much? A hundred dollars. Youre on fuzzbrain. Get out your wallet! Boy five inches higher wouldve done it. You ALWAYS get me in trouble. You owe me $2500 so far.
26/02/94
Why should OTHER people benefit from MY hard work?
27/02/94
Ah what a lovely day to go sailing eh Marsha? Our new boat is just wonderful Bradley. What do you say we drop anchor and go for a swim dearest? That sounds delightful darling! Lets go! Ploosh ploosh. AAA!! AAA!! This lake is boiling hot! Were getting scalded!! Get out of the water! AA! OW! AA! OW! Ive got second degree burns all over! What kind of lake IS this?! We need medical attention Bradley! Pull up the anchor! Bradley were going the wrong way! I cant help it Marsha! The wind is blowing us over here toward the... the... THE WATERFALL! OH NO! AAAAA! BLUB BLUB! AAAA! GLUB GLUB GLUB! Help help! The wind is picking up again! Hang on! Were flying right out of the water! Dont look don Marsh! Were miles high! Uh oh! The wind suddenly stopped!! AAAAaaaaaaaa. We ... were alive! Somehow we landed in another lake! But where ARE we?? I have a bad feeling about this Bradley. ITS A GIGANTIC WHIRLPOOL!! WERE GOING DOWN! WAAAAAA!! Heres the problem. Thatll be $150. Somebody ELSE is going to pay for this too.
28/02/94
Should I stay inside or go out? Its awfully cold out but I suppose I could bundle up. It looks windy though. But still Id like to go sledding. Then again maybe Id rather stay in. On the other hand... GO OUT AND CLOSE THE DOOR! The more indecisive I am the faster things get decided.
01/03/94
I like following the news! News organizations know I wont sit still for any serious discussion of complex and boring issues. They give me what I want: antics emotional confrontation sound bites scandal sob stories and popularity polls all packaged as a soap opera and horse race! Its very entertaining. Then commentators wonder why the public is cynical about politics. You can tell this is an in-depth story because its got an article next to the chart.
02/03/94
I saw a sing on a restaurant door that said No shirt no shoes no service. But it didnt say anything about PANTS! If I went in wearing shoes and a shirt but no pants theyd have to serve me! Theyd probably serve you with a court summons. Cmon lets see if Mom will take us out for dinner!
03/03/94
There! Whatcha doin? Ive hidden a cache of snowballs behind every tree in the yard! Now when my enemies come after me I need only run to the nearest tree to be instantly armed. Ingenious. Now I need to make some enemies. Ill be one.
04/03/94
It offends the human ego that nature is indifferent to us. Nature doesnt care if people live or die. It refuses to be tamed. It does whatever it wants and acts like people dont matter. It wont confirm our right to be here. That drives people crazy. We cant stand being ignored. Its insulting and ... hey! YAWWNN. I think thats also why some people dont like cats.
05/03/94
Im writing a novel. Whats it about? Its about a guy who flicks through TV channels with his remote control. THEY SAY TO WRITE WHAT YOU KNOW!
06/03/94
Look at all the stars! The universe just goes out forever and ever! It kind of makes you wonder why man considers himself such a big screaming deal. Thats why we stay inside with our appliances.
07/03/94
Take out your math homework and pass it forward class. Boy Its a good thing I did it. Huh?? My answers! Theyre running away! Come back! My homework paper!
08/03/94
My homework exploded! Somebody pull the fire alarm! Help!! Its out of control! Its spreading! Aughh! Put it out!! Young man Im tired of these constant disruptions! Its not my fault! It was an accident! Maybe THIS will teach you a lesson! Ha ha ha! No! No! Ackk! Help! Get the PTA! Miss Wormwoods an alien!
09/03/94
Im doomed! Its too late! Nothing can save me now! Im going down in flames! AAAAAAA
10/03/94
AAAA GAAA!! Hehh... hoo... hah... hehh... ...it was just a dream... my homework didnt explode. Im not... MY HOMEWORK! I FORGOT TO DO MY HOMEWORK! I wish hed sleep outside.
11/03/94
Hobbes wake up! I forgot to do my math homework! Its two in the morning. But Miss Wormwoods going to collect it tomorrow! If I dont have it shell kill me! I had a nightmare about it! Cmon well have to do the assignment now while theres still time! This feels like a nightmare too. Do you think if we woke up Mom shed let us have coffee?
12/03/94
Wow listen to the wind howl. Its really snowing! Pretty creepy. Things are ALWAYS creepy at 2:00am. Hey Ill bet tomorrows a snow day! Ill bet they close the schools! Lets call the superintendent and see! If tomorrows a snow day we can go right back to bed! ...or maybe we will anyway. Who IS this?!? You have two seconds to improve my mood.
13/03/94
No text
14/03/94
Time to get up Calvin. Is it a snow day? Did they close the schools? Ive got the radio on so well hear. Get ready anyway though. Oh man I hope I hope I hope. If schools closed Ill have the whole day to do the math homework I forgot yesterday. If schools open Im in big trouble. Suddenly I feel extremely religious. Another deathbed conversion.
15/03/94
Ha ha! They just announced the schools are closed! Its a snow day! WHEEEEEEE! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Talk about luck! Now you can do your homework and you wont get in trouble! Right but theres over two feet of snow that requires our immediate and undivided attention. First things first. Math will still be there when the snow melts.
16/03/94
Dont you think youd enjoy this more if you did your math assignment first so it wasnt hanging over your head? Im a practical man Hobbes. I dont waste time thinking about hypothetical situations. I heal with the world here and now. And the incontrovertible fact is that Im outside in the snow! THATs reality! THATs what I think about! Tomorrows a reality too. Hypothetically it might be another snow day.
17/03/94
What a busy day! Im pooped! Mom says the roads are pretty clear so school will probably open again tomorrow. NOW I wish Id done my math homework instead of playing outside all day. ...or I wish Id done it before dinner... or after dinner... or instead of watching TV... or before bed. But now its too late. A day can really slip by when youre deliberately avoiding what youre supposed to do.
18/03/94
Oh I wish Id done my math homework! Now the teachers going to collect it and Im as good as dead! Why did I do this to meyself?! I even had an extra day to get it done! Instead I goofed off and now Im going to pay for it! Boy Ive learned my lesson! This day has been nothing but dread and I couldve avoided it all! Here she comes! Goodbye world! Ill collect your homework tomorrow class. Susie quick. Am I sitting in a beam of light? Looks more like a puddle of sweat. Why?
19/03/94
I couldnt believe it! The bell rang just as the teacher was about to collect the homework I didnt do! Thats twice youve been saved at the last minute. But Ive learned my lesson THIS time. From now on its work before pleasure! No exceptions! And it will be a PLEASURE to have that homework done! Cmon lets work on a snowman. No exceptions.
20/03/94
Time! Wow 15 minutes and 20 seconds! Ha! Beat that! Weekends dont count unless you spend them doing something completely pointless. GO!
21/03/94
Im determined to set the world record for having ones finger continuously in ones nose. I cant believe theres even such a category. In that case call me champ!
22/03/94
This piece of pie is awfully darn small! Life could be worse Calvin. Life could be a lot BETTER too! ...but worse is more likely.
23/03/94
Ive decided to suffer from low self-esteem. Is that a fact. From now on my goal is to feel good about myself. Youre going to work harder at everything and build character? No Im going to whine until I get the special treatment I like. I wonder if anyone else is as scared about the future as I am. Ive found that immediate gratification is the only thing that helps me.
24/03/94
Ewww! Whats this something scraped off the bottom of boots?? Im not eating it! Calvin I made this last week and you said it was your favorite meal of all time and you wished we could have it every day for the rest of your life! Well now I hate it. Another day another gray hair for Mom!
25/03/94
Im ho-oOAAUGH! KAPOW! Man this was cat a-pulted! Hee hee hee! Youre a riot Hobbes.
26/03/94
These colors really arent enough so I have to mix some to get the specific hues I need. See here I start with a layer of brown. Then I add olive green and scrub a little orange and yellow ochre into it. Finally I top it with lime green purple and tan. Wow perfect barf! Youd think that would be a standard color in a big set like this.
27/03/94
You know Hobbes some days even my luck rocketship underpants dont help. Well youve done all you can do.
28/03/94
I dont like your face. Then dont look at it. Id rather change it. Haw! I dont care about being accepted. Id settle for being ignored.
29/03/94
Greetings. I am Blor-Utar from Zimtok-5. I have come to subjugate the human race. Do not resist. Why humans? Because in addition to their value as slave labor they are also delicious and nutritious! Ha ha ha! But first for your Earth customer of Show and Tell I will exhibit some of our terrifying weaponry. Snekk blog u-lar mekhh! Gahghh! Rk! All right Calvin thats quite enough. Miss Wormwood shouldnt he be in some special school or something?
30/03/94
When it snows you can go sledding. When its windy you can fly kites. When its hot you can go swimming. But when its raining... sigh... ... the only sport is driving Mom crazy.
31/03/94
I thought I had a great idea. But it never really took off. In fact it didnt even get on the runway. I guess you could say it exploded in the hangar. Ive had ideas like that.
01/04/94
ZZZZZZZZ How could you miss that? It was right TO you! You throw too hard!
02/04/94
Ewww look! This bug is eating another bug! Yukkk! Blecchh! Gross! Ick! Ick! Blbpbblpth! I cant believe I looked at that! Ew! Ew! Hacckkhh! Gaaacck! Great experiences are even better when theyre shared.
03/04/94
...YAWWNN... OOMP! WAAAAAAAAAAA. LET GO OF ME YOU MALEVOLENT MUREROUS MORON!! Its MORNING! Now we can do stuff again! Cmon! Wheee!
04/04/94
Where do we keep the extension cords? In the pantry. On the bottom shelf. Where do we keep the blades for Dads electric saw? In the... why do you want to know? Huh? Oh Im just making an inventory list so well always know where to find things. I get the feeling there was no right answer to that question.
05/04/94
Calvin come out from wherever you are hiding and take your bath! DO YOU HEAR ME CALVIN?! I MEAN NOW! OH NO! LOOK AT YOU! AUGH! GET OFF THE RUG! Like it was MY fault she hasnt gotten the chimney swept.
06/04/94
Mom! Mom! I just saw the first robin of spring! Call the newspaper quick! Ha ha! A front page write-up! A commemorative plaque! A civic ceremony! All for me! Hooray! Hooray! Oh boy! Should I put the prize money in a trust fund or blow it all at once? Ha ha! I cant believe I did it! Calvin... Its a hard bitter cruel world to have to grow up in Hobbes. Cheer up! Did I tell you I saw a robin yesterday?
07/04/94
I sure like chocolate frosted sugar bombs! Look how brown the milk gets! Ugh. Want to see something weird? Look at the nutritional information on the back panel. Wow. 100% of the daily recommended allowance of caffeine! Hey look! You can send away for a chocolate frosted sugar bombs Buzzy the Hummingbird doll!
08/04/94
Eenie meenie miney moe! Catch a tiger by the toe! If he hollers um... Uh... Heh heh... Who writes these dumb things anyway?
09/04/94
County library? Yes do you have any books on homemade bombs? Thats what I said. I need a book that lists supplies and gives step-by-step instructions for building rigging and detonating them. Well what about your other branches? Dont THEY have any books like that? Boy and people wonder why kids dont read.
10/04/94
Ugh I hate going to the subconscious. Me too! Why doesnt anyone ever clean this dump? Heres a movie reel. I suppose its as good as any. I grabbed these two. Lets get them back to central cognition. W can run this reel first. I hope these are ebtter than last nights movies. Hurry up! The lights are dimming! Help me thread the projector! Yikes this is awful! Where did you guys FIND this? Oops the next reel isnt even from the same film. Good! Put it on! This one is even worse! I guess its some sort of suspense movie. Why cant we ever watch anything good? Maybe YOU should get the movies next time! AUGH! Monsters! Monsters! Turn it off! Too scary!! Quick try another reel! This one makes no sense! Whats going on?? Has this been dubbed from some other language? None of these make sense! Were splicing them all out of order. What a waste of time! The lights are coming back on! Shows over! Finally! I thought this would never end. Back to work! Man your stations! Full alert! Whoo I had so many strange dreams! ... I wonder what they mean.
11/04/94
IM FREE! IM FREE! At last! Home sweet ho... Oh no. Hoo hoo! That was a GOOD one! Look how far we landed! A house with a tiger is never home.
12/04/94
Look at you! How could anyone get so dirty at school? I got this dirty just trying to walk in the front door! Ol catapult butt was lying in wait for me. Well it doesnt matter. Youd better get in the tub now anyway. A BATH?! But its the middle of the afternoon! Yes but I have to get in the shower before your Dad gets home so HE can take one. Why all the baths? Is there some epidemic going around? I told you this morning were going out tonight. Rosalyn will be here at 6:0
13/04/94
Look I know you dont like Rosalyn but shes the only babysitter I could get. And you remember our talk after what happened LAST time dont you? I want you on your best behavior tonight.You do exactly what she tells you. I dont want to come home and hear any horror stories OK? For goodness sake Calvin! Take a breath before you pass out on the floor!
14/04/94
What are we going to DO Hobbes? Rosalyn will be here in just a few hours! Do you think shell remember how you locked her outside last time? If she does were dead! Shell probably stick my head on a stake in the front yard as a warning to OTHER kids she baby-sits! Im almost sure that would violate some zoning ordinance. Well no matter what were in big trouble unless we think of something FAST! I suppose we could try being GOOD. I mustve gotten water in my ear. WHAT did you say? Nothing. Forget it.
15/04/94
Hi Rosalyn come on in. Thanks for coming again. No trouble. Hi Rosalyn! You dont need to worry THIS time. Calvin will be on his best behavior tonight. Even so Id like an advance. An advance? But... But... Dear may I speak with you for a moment? But we GAVE her an advance on tonight when she LEFT last time! I dont care. Just pay what it takes to get us out of here!
16/04/94
OK were going. ... and Calvin? Yes? GCKKHHK! I think Ill sit in the middle of the floor and look at the wall tonight. Good. Ill tell you when its bedtime.
17/04/94
The fearless Spaceman Spiff interplanetary explorer extraordinaire gazes across the forbidding landscape of an uncharted planet! What dangers lie ahead for our hero? What horrible aliens inhabit this world? What strange adventures await the intrepid Spiff? What bizarre occurrence will our hero be the first to witness? The suspense! ...Our hero chucks a few rocks. ...sighhh... If you couldnt find any weirdness maybe well just have to MAKE some! Now yer talkin!
18/04/94
This is awful! If we step out of line ONCE tonight Rosalyn will kill us and then Mom and Dad will kill us again when they get home. I guess thats that. What?! Admit defeat? NEVER! Things may look grim for us but NOTHING is grim for... ...STUPENDOUS MAN! Champion of Liberty! Foe of tyranny! Im going to get in bed now and avoid the rush.
19/04/94
A bolt of fiery crimson streaks across the sky! Its STUPENDOUS MAN! The fiendish baby sitter girl has a local household in her iron grip of terror! The man of mega-might zooms to the rescue! Im in luck! Baby sitter girl is momentarily distracted! Hi Charlie its Rosalyn. Yeah Im over at the little monsters house again. Hmm? No actually hes been pretty good tonight. Yeah I cant believe it.
20/04/94

FREEDOM AND JUSTICE SHALL ALWAYS PREVAIL OVER TYRANNY BABY SITTER GIRL! Get off me Calvin you pest! Ow! Let go! Quit it! STUPENDOUS MAN has the strength of a million mortal men! Give up! Listen Charlie Im going to have to call you back. You wouldnt believe what this cretin is wearing. With muscles of magnitude STUPENDOUS MAN fights with heroic resolve!
21/04/94
OK Calvin you want to play rough huh? Great moons of Neptune! She must have super powers too! Youve got TWO seconds to get your caped butt in bed or Ill put it there for good! Oh no! The evil Amazon is using some psycho-beam to weaken my stupendous will! Im counting! ONNNNE... *Gasp* I... I... must resist! TWO! In a vermillion flash STUPENDOUS MAN is in the air!
22/04/94
With stupendous speed STUPENDOUS MAN is out the door! All right Calvin! Whered you go?! I know youre out here! Your parents told you to BEHAVE tonight remember?! Theyre not going to be happy when they hear about THIS! See if we had bought a dog instead like I wanted we could go out like this all the time. Honey we came here to relax. Lets talk about something else.
23/04/94
There is no way Im getting paid enough for this kind of aggravation. How could a kid with such little legs go so fast?! Secure in his secret fortress STUPENDOUS MAN plans his strategy! Baby sitter girl is no match for STUPENDOUS MANs stupendous intellect! Calvin youre in big trouble if you dont come out! You made it back alive! Of course! I made a stupendous dash as soon as Rosalyn went around the house! She STILL doesnt know where I am!
24/04/94
Bwa ha ha ha ee hee hee hee hee ehh heh heh heh ... a little more... a little more... PFOOSH! AAA! I wont fill this one so full. There! Perfect! heh heh. Dark knot! Ackk blpp! Stop it! Pbtt! Its too slippery! Ackpth! Blp! Now look its almost empty! Ill have to fill it again. Stupid balloon. ...a little more... ah! Perfect! IT SLIPPED OFF! FWOOSH.
25/04/94
There goes Rosalyn around the house again. She still doesnt know you sneaked back inside. Now Ill change back into my secret identity alter ego! Uh oh. She saw the light on in this room. Shes coming in! Quick! Get in the covers! Pretend weve just been reading in bed! But she knows you attacked her and ran outside half an hour ago! That was STUPENDOUS MAN! Not mild-mannered Calvin! IVE been in bed with my PJs since 8:00. You think shes going to believe THAT? My covers are here. My pajamas are HERE. Its as plain as can be!
26/04/94
All right! I found you! Found?? Why what do you mean? Ive been in bed reading all evening with Hobbes. Dont give me that! You just now sneaked inside took off your silly costume and jumped in bed! I know what you did! Well youre gonna get it NOW bucko! Oh yea? What are you going to do to me huh? You cant send me to bed when Im already IN bed! Sorry to spoil your fun you eel! OK. Downstairs! MARCH! Hey you cant take me OUT of bed! I need my SLEEP! Hey! Hey!
27/04/94
While your Dad is taking Rosalyn home perhaps YOUD like to explain what happened tonight. Gosh Mom whats to tell? At 8:00 I put on my pajamas brushed my teeth and went straight to bed. Nothing happened. And this? Uh... LIES! All lies! Rosalyn made me do that just so Id get in trouble! She hates kids! None of that is true! I went straight to bed! Nice try Pinocchio. Well whod have thought Rosalyn would make me write a full confession?!
28/04/94
No TV for a week! What injustice! They think theyve won but they havent! ILL show em! I REFUSE to learn a lesson! Im indomitable! They cant change me! Ill sit in front of the TV all week even if I cant turn it on!
29/04/94
Dad will you explain the theory of relativity to me? I dont understand why time goes slower at great speed. Its because you keep changing time zones. See if you fly to California you gain three hours on a five-hour flight right? So if you go at the speed of light you gain MORE time because it doesnt take as long to get there. Of course the theory of relativity works only if youre going west. Gee thats not what Mom said at ALL! She must be totally off her rocker. Well we men are better at abstract reasoning. Go tell her that.
30/04/94
Mom can we go out to the highway? Do what? See Ill put on my roller skates and tie a rope from the car bumper to my waist. Then when I give you the high five you patch out while I ride behind at 55 mph! What do you say? Can we go? I sure wish YOU could drive.
01/05/94
Hobbes have me the story idea. Flip the pages again! This was MY book!
02/05/94
Wow! Nobody is on the swings! I cant believe it! Ha ha! I almost NEVER get a swing at recess! This is great! No one is telling me to hurry up! Higher! Higher! Whee! ... either this is my lucky day or I missed the end-of-recess bell again.
03/05/94
Hey Calvin didnt you sign up to play baseball at recess? No why? You must be the only boy who didnt. All the others are playing in the back fields. You mean Im the only boy on a playground full of GIRLS?! It sure looks like it. Want to ride on the teeter-totter with me? Oh no! Im in COOTIE CENTRAL! I havent had my shots! Relax. Stupidity produces antibodies. Air filter! Air filter!
04/05/94
Why didnt you sign up to play baseball like the rest of the boys? Didnt you like sports? I dunno. Id just rather run around. I hate all the rules and organization and teams and ranks in sports. Somebodys always yelling at you telling you where to be what to do and when to do it. I figure when I want THAT Ill join the army and at least get paid.
05/05/94
Hey lookit the sissy who didnt sign up for recess baseball. Im not a sissy! Oh yeah? Youd rather play dolls on the playground with girls. I wasnt playing with dolls! Sure you werent! Let me see your Barbie doll you sissy wimp! Im not a wimp! In fact I was going to the office to sign up for baseball right now! Then again if Im not a wimp why am I taking the path of least resistance?
06/05/94
I signed up to play baseball every recess and I dont even like baseball that much. I mean its fun playing baseball with just YOU because we both get to pitch bat run and catch all at once. We get to DO everything. Mostly we just argue over the rules we make up! Thats the part I like! But this will be with TEAMS and assigned positions and an umpire! Its BORING playing it the REAL way! Do you have know HOW to play the real way? See thats another problem! Suppose they make me a halfback. Can I tackle the shortstop or not?
07/05/94
I hear you signed up to play softball at recess. Yeah but I didnt even want to. I just did it to stop getting teased. Well sports are good for you. They teach teamwork and cooperation. You learn how to win graciously and accept defeat. It builds character. Every time Ive built character Ive regretted it! I dont WANT to learn teamwork! I dont WANT to learn about winning and losing! Heck I dont even want to COMPETE! Whats wrong with just having fun by yourself huh?! When you grow up its not allowed. All the more reason I should do it NOW!
08/05/94
DING DONG. Im coming Im coming. AAAA! I OPENED THE DOOR AND MY BIKE GOT IN!! HELLPP! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!! ITS AN UNBALANCED BICYCLE!! SOMEBODY GET ME A SPOKE WRENCH! Hehh hoo hehh hoo. BACK! BACK! SLAM. Ha! You cant get me now! AIEE! TIRE TRACKS ON THE RUGS! OIL ON THE COUCH! WHERES THAT KID?! Someday the neighbors will look out and wonder why theres a grown up man wearing a kids clothes on our roof.
09/05/94
Come ON. Calvin! We were supposed to have left a half-hour ago. WHERE are we going? For the hundredth time were going to a wedding. Now get in the car. Your Dads waiting. But what if I forgot something? Were only going overnight. Youll get by.
10/05/94
Turn around! We forgot Hobbes! Stop the car! We cant turn around Calvin. Were late already. But DA-AD!! You couldve been ready on time and had all your things together but you put up a fuss about going made us late and you forgot your tiger. Its your own fault. Youd turn around if wed forgotten MOM! Thats because shes the only one who knows where the place is. Har har.
11/05/94
When is this dumb wedding going to be over?! I dont even KNOW these people. This would be a lot more fun if Hobbes was here. I cant believe we left him at home. I hope hes OK. Whats he going to eat? We didnt leave any food out and well be gone almost two whole days! Hobbes will be starving! I think Ill let Dad go into the house first.
12/05/94
Hey Mom how do you make a long-distance call from our motel room? Dont play with the phone Calvin. Who on earth do you want to call? Hobbes. I want to make sure hes OK. Hobbes isnt going to answer the phone. Dont be silly. Youll see him tomorrow. But hes probably all lonely! Im sure hes having a good time. I hope he isnt renting some movie that I wanted to see.
13/05/94
Mom I cant sleep. Im sure you can if you just lie quietly. But Hobbes isnt here. Tigers are very comforting. I always fall right asleep when I listen to Hobbes breathing. Well you can listen to your Dad snoring. Thats Dad? I thought theose were trucks down-shifting on the highway.
14/05/94
Well were finally home! HOORAYY! Now I get to see Hobbes! Boy I didnt think wed EVER get home. The whole trip was one long complaint about leaving Hobbes behind. Next time we should take the tiger and forget the kid. Gosh its drafty in here... The windows smashed! Look at the glass! SOMEBODY BROKE IN!! HOBBES! FIND HOBBES!
15/05/94
I ordered the two tons of tenderloin. Oh yes. Drive around to the loading dock and Ill get the forklift. Calvin lunchtime! Mayounnaise?! I like mustard! Maybe you should fix your OWN triceratops sandwich.
16/05/94
Oh my gosh!! Somebody broke into our house!! Ill call the police! WHERES HOBBES? I cant believe this is happening! Look at this room! HOBBES! Oh I KNEW we shouldnt have left him here! Mom I cant find Hobbes! Help me find him! What if... what if they... Its OK Calvin. Calm down. Im sure Hobbes is here somewhere. I dont think anyone would steal a suffed tiger. Cmon lets go look. But Hobbes is so TRUSTING... sniff
17/05/94
The police say theyll send someone over. Have you figured out what all is missing? No were looking for Hobbes. Calvins almost hysterical. I feel a little hysterical myself. Ooh... I hope the police get here quick. Im scared. This is one of those things you always figure will happen to someone else. ... Unfortunately were ALL someone else to someone else.
18/05/94
Hobbes? Hobbes? Where are you?? I TOLD Mom and Dad we left Hobbes behind... I TRIED to get them to turn around and come back... and NOW look Hobbes was all alone when our house was broken into! Mom says Hobbes wouldnt have been stolen because hes not valuable. ...(sniff) Well I think hes valuable.
19/05/94
Hobbes? Are you down there? Youve got to be SOMEwhere! HERE HE IS CALVIN! I FOUND HOBBES! You FOUND him! Is he OK?? Hes not hurt is he? Hes fine. He was under the bed covers. Hobbes Im so glad to see you!! Youre safe and sound! (sniff) And now I am too! It looks like were a whole family again. Such as it is yes.
20/05/94
... and the televisions gone too. Do you happen to have the serial number? Ill bet the burglars got scared off when they saw there was a tiger in the house! Hobbes was here the whole time! Calvin not now OK? Im busy. Nobody sticks around long when he sees a tiger thats for sure! Mandibles of death thats what Hobbes has! Roght. Why dont you go tell your Mom? Maybe Hobbes should look at some mug shots. Can we go to the station and identify suspects? Huh can we? DEAR! I sure meet some weirdos in this job.
21/05/94
Ive swept up most of the glass from the window. OK Ill get something to cover up the hole. Do you think its safe to stay here tonight? Suppose the burglars come back! The police said theyd drive by and well leave lots of lights on. Ugh its so creepy knowing these goons have been in our house. I dont feel safe at all. I known. And this must REALLY be scary for a little kid like Calvin. Gosh I cant wait to tell everyone at school how our house got robbed. Be sure to say who scared the burglars away after they took the TV and jewelry.
22/05/94
Look a snake! A big one! You think its poisonous? Beats me. How can you tell? If it bites you and you die its poisonous. Har har. Look how it glides along. Its almost like a liquid. I wonder how they do that. Hes flicking his tongue out. I think thats how they smell but why would they smell with a tongue? Do snakes have eyelids? Do they sleep with their eyes open? Dont snakes eat mice? How could a snake swallow something bigger than its own head? Heck we dont know ANYTHING about snakes. Maybe your Mom would get us a book. Yeah lets go see! Well be experts! Well learn all there is to know! Hey wait a minute! Its summer! Im on vacation! I dont want to LEARN anything! If nobody makes you do it it counts as fun. Hmm... you really think so? Cooooooll.
23/05/94
Is Calvin asleep? Yes hes snuggled up with Hobbes. Boy I dont know how IM ever going to sleep. Me neither. I cant get over whats happened. The idea of some crazy stranger going through our house... BRRRR!! I wish I had a big stuffed animal to feel safe with. I guess youll have to do. So what do I get to snuggle? How come IM the grown-up??
24/05/94
This is going to be a long night. My heart jumps at the slightest sound. Its almost 2 and Im wide awake. When someone breaks into your home it shatters your last illusion of security. If youre not safe in your own home youre not safe anywhere. A mans home is his castle but it shouldnt have to be a fortress.
25/05/94
Are you still awake too? Mm-hmm. I was thinking. Its funny... when I was a kid I thought grown-ups never worried about anything. I trusted my parents to take care of everything and it never occurred to me that they might not know how. I figured that once you grew up you automatically knew what to do in any given scenario. I dont think Id have been in such a hurry to reach adulthood if Id known the whole thing was going to be ad-libbed.
26/05/94
Well at least we werent in our home when our house was broken into. No one was hurt. Were all together and OK. We lost a few of our nice things but things dont matter much really. Its hard to believe how often we forget that.
27/05/94
Can I be excused now? You didnt finish your dinner. Well I didnt like it very much and theres this TV show I want to watch so... Our TV was stolen remember? Gosh I guess Ill eat my asparagus do my homework and go straight to bed then. And were so proud of how you handle adversity.
28/05/94
This is where our television used to be. But we dont have a TV any more. Now we have a blank wall to watch. So here I am not being entertained. A pointless existence huh? I mean the wall is even plain old WHITE!
29/05/94
..h-hott.... ahhhh. ...not again...
30/05/94
Good news Hobbes! Im starting a secret club and you can be in it! Oh boy! Itll be great! Well think of secret names for ourselves secret codes for our secret correspondence a secret handshake... Well have a secret club-house with a secret known to get in and well do big secretive things! Why all the secrecy? People pay more attention to you when they think youre up to something.
31/05/94
OK the first thing we need is a name for our secret club. Lets call it The Hobbes Fan Club! THE HOBBES FAN CLUB?! GIVE ME A BREAK! IM SURE! This is a top-secret society! The name should be something mysterious! Something vaguely ominous and chilling! Something like The Sinister Icy Black Hand of Death Club! I still like my idea better.
01/06/94
I got it! Well call our club G.R.O.S.S. - Get Rid Of Slimy girlS! That way Susie Derkins cant join! Is she slimy? ALL girls are slimy. Now the first order of business is to elect officers. I get to be president! I get to be president! Oh no you dont! This whole club was my idea so I get to be president. OK then I get to be king and tyrant. Hey no! THATS what I want to be! You can be President.
02/06/94
Hi Calvin! What are you doing making paper hats? Can I make one too? Dont be ridiculous. This is the official chapeau of our top-secret club G.R.O.S.S. - Get Rid Of Slimy girlS! Slimy girls?! I know thats redundant but otherwise it doesnt spell anything. Now go away. GIRLS ARENT SLIMY! Dont get gunk on me. I took bath last Saturday and Im all clean.
03/06/94
I cant believe you started a secret club just to exclude girls! Theres nothing wrong with girls! See Hobbes? Girls are so emotional. Youre the meanest most rotten little kid I know! Well fine! Play with your stuffed tiger! See what I care! I dont want to play with a stinker like you anyway!! Wow what a great club!
04/06/94
OK weve got a sign for our secret club so now we need to find a secret meeting place. I know! We can set up a card table in the garage! That would be perfect for drawing up maps and stuff! Hmm theres not much room with the car here. Lets push it into the drive. Shouldnt you ask your Mom to move it instead? Nahh. She wont care if we push it out. Cmon. In the past youve been a remarkably poor judge of what your Mom cares about.
05/06/94
We all want meaningful lives. We look for meaning in everything we do. But suppose there IS no meaning! Suppose life is fundamentally absurd! Suppose theres no reason or truth or rightness in anything! What if nothing means anything? What if nothing really matters? I guess theres no harm in a little wishful thinking. Or suppose EVERYTHING matters. Which would be worse??
06/06/94
Help me push the car out of the garage. I cant budge it myself. I still think you should ask your Mom to move it. Then shed probably say no and we wont have the garage for our clubhouse! But if you DONT ask her well get in trouble. We wont get in trouble! Every time you say that we go. Mom wouldnt care about these things if she wouldnt keep finding out about them.
07/06/94
Look stop being such a baby and help me push the car into the driveway. Well move it 10 feet. What could possibly go wrong?! Whenever you ask that my tail gets all bushy. Oh knock it off. Mom will be glad we did this ourselves and didnt bother her. Well she DOES hate to be bothered. Right. Now push! Push! Hey the cars not stopping! STOP! STOP! I think youre Moms going to be bothered.
08/06/94
STOP THE CAR! ITS STILL ROLLING! The driveway must be slanted downhill! Its going faster! WHOA! WHOA! Jump in and pull the emergency brake! I cant catch the door! Oh no! Oh no! Its going to go into the road! Dont follow it! LOOK OUT! WILD CAR!!
09/06/94
I havent seen Calvin for about 15 minutes now. That probably means hes getting in trouble.
10/06/94
The car is rolling into the road!! What if someone hits it?!? LOOK OUT! LOOK OUT! THERES NO ONE DRIVING!! THERE IT GOES!! I cant watch! GRUNTCH Nobody hit it! It just went into the ravine across the street! Hooray were dead.
11/06/94
Oh man oh man oh man. Oh man. What do you suppose a car like this costs? Ill bet at LEAST $75. Oh MAN.
12/06/94
Oh boy! Its bedtime! SPROINGG. WOOOOOO. WULP! FWAPP SHOONK SWOOOSHHH SPLOOSH WAA! SHOOP THWUPP OOF! ...ahhh. Bedtime. Lets go. Aww I hate getting ready for bed.
13/06/94
My life is flashing becore my eyes. Yeah I doubt your parents figured youd wreck their car before you were 16.
14/06/94
What are we going to do?? Well never get the car out of the raving. Should we act surprised like the car just rolled here by itself? Maybe Mom and Dad would fall for that. Or maybe they wont even notice if we just dont say anything. You think? I can be packed in five minutes. OK Ill try to get the maps out of the glove compartment.
15/06/94
Hi Mom! Hobbes and I are back! Do I have any clean clothes? I mean Im just wondering. Im going to make myself a few dozen sandwiches! Uh... Im REALLY hungry! No need to get up or look for example out of the window! Just stay where you are for another 10 minutes! Whats the matter with you? AAUGHH! Ha ha ha ha! Nothing! Uh why do you ask??
16/06/94
I got a couple of sandwiches made but I think Mom was getting suspicious. Are you packed? Wed better go! Should I take the yo-yo or the bubbles? ... or both? HOBBES COME ON! Well be lucky to get out of here with our LIVES! Moms bound to look outside any minute now and see the car in the ditch! If were not in the next county by then its curtains! Lets GO! Wheres a freight train when you really need one?
17/06/94
POOF POOF POOF POOF POOF OK (POOF)... I think weve got enough of a head start. We can rest a minute. Do you think your Mom has seen the car by now? Probably. Shes probably called Dad at work and hes probably on his way home now!
18/06/94
Well were surely in some other state by now. Lets stop here. Boy it never once occurred to me that Id be spending the rest of my life on the lam. Speaking of lamb what kind of sandwiches did you bring? How can you think of eating? Im so worried I feel sick. Really? Can I have your sandwich too? Six years old and a fugitive from justice. I cant believe it.
19/06/94
Hup. PTCHOO AAA! Thpkxx! Hayfever season isnt ALL bad. You thig ids fuddy bud ids dot. SLAM. Thxxxptb!
20/06/94
Whats going on. I wonder. Why are all those cars slowing down as they go by? Gosh did someone have an accident? It looks like theres a car in the ditch! ... but I dont see anyone by it. And how on earth did they go in straight backward? To do that the car wouldve had to come... ...right...out...our...driveway!
21/06/94
Well Moms sure to have found the car by now and guessed what we did. Now I know what they mean when they say you cant go home again.
22/06/94
Whats that sound? I dont hear anything. There! Something is crashing through the brush! It It sounds big! Maybe its a bear! There are BEARS out here?? Climb the tree! Climb the tree! If you ask ME tigers are the only ferocious animals the world really needs. Boy 6 killed by bear! Parents saved the trouble.
23/06/94
Do you think were safe? Should we climb higher? Its hard to say with bears. There it is! The bears coming out of the brush! Oh no! It looks like its on its hind legs! Bears stand up only when theyre really mad!! Wait thats not a bear. Thats your Mom! AAUGHH! EVEN WORSE! CLIMB HIGHER! CLIMB HIGHER!
24/06/94
THERE you are. Come down so I can talk to you. No. Youll kill us. Were running away. Im not going to kill you. I just wanted to find out what happened. Are you OK? Was anyone hurt? No one was hurt. We were pushing the car into the drive and it kept rolling. The car didnt hit anything? It just went across the road and into the ditch. Thats when we took off. Well the tow truck pulled it out and theres no damage so you can come home now. First lets hear you say you love me.
25/06/94
Boy Hobbes isnt it funny how things sometimes work out? Mom and Dad saw right away that what happened to the car was an accident. They were so relieved no one got hurt that all we got was a lecture on safety and asking permission. They didnt even raise their voices. Parents are inscrutable huh? Send their car over a ditch and you dont even get yelled at. ...but try keeping live worms in your Dads... Lets not talk about that OK?!
26/06/94
My Mom and Dad are not what they seem. Their dull appearance is part of their scheme. I know of their plans. I know their techniques. My parents are outer space alien freaks! They landed on Earth in spaceships humongous. Posing as grownups they now walk among us. My parents deny this but I know the truth. Theyre here to enslave me and spoil my youth. Eary each morning as the sun rises Mom and Dad put on their earthling disguises. I knew right away their masks werent legit. Their faces are lined - they sag and dont fit. The Earths gravity makes them sluggish and slow. They say not to run wherever I go. They live by the clock. Theyre slaves to routine. They work the year round. Theyre almost machines. They deny that TV and fried food have much worth. They cannot be human. Theyre not of this Earth. I cannot escape their alien gaze and theyre warping my mind with their alien ways. For sinister plots this one is a gem. Theyre bringing me up to turn ME into THEM!
27/06/94
CLICK. Pander to me!
28/06/94
Playing a record? Ill show you something interesting. Compare a point on the label with a point on the records outer edge. They both make a complete circule in the same amount of time right? Yeah... but the point on the records edge has to make a bigger circule in the same time so it goes faster. See two points on one disk move at two speeds even though they both make the same revolutions per minute!
29/06/94
On your mark... get set... GO! IM going so slow Im moving BACKWARD! Im winning! Thats cheating!
30/06/94
Hello? Hi Dad! Calvin is this important? Oops. Wait. Foget I called you Dad OK? This isnt Calvin. Calvin Ive got work to do. Ill see you when I get home. OK? Goodbye. Wait! Do you have any crimes to report? Phooey. This secret identity stuff is hard to get used to.
01/07/94
Want to see something cool? Ive got a baby tooth thats just hanging by a thread... and I can turn it all the way around with my tongue... or make it swing from side to side! See? See? Theyre all just jealous.
02/07/94
LOOK! I dont see anything. You missed it. Well Im done. What did he see? An opportunity.
03/07/94
BLOGG! Ukh huggablukk Spiff! Spiff?! Blecckh blecckh! We join our here the courageous Spaceman Spiff as he flees the awful bug beings of Zartron-9! Spiffs only chance is a daring strategy of head-to-head combat! Our hero swings around and readies his computer-guided death-ray blaster! ..tum te tum tum... I wish this booted up faster. Cmon cmon. There we go. Lets see. Get the file icon... double click on blaster... Hmm pull down settings... get the dialog box... click on rays... select death... hit OK. Hey whats the matter? Why didnt my screen change?! Hit F1 for help... About blasters... nope... Calibrating blasters... nope... charging the fizzler... no... fizzling the charger... no... incineration guidelines... oh this is annoying! Oh wait I didnt enter the number of volts! Thats it! Type in gazillion hit OK. What?! Invalid setting. DARN! Go back to volts highlight gazillion press Delete type in... KRAKK. SPIFF IS HIT! HES GOING DOWN! Hey why wont this boot up? Has somebody been playing with this thing?! The whole thing went down Dad. Luckily I jumped clear at the last second.
04/07/94
Can I be excused? Theres a TV show I want to see. Were still eating dinner Calvin. IM through. This stuff was awful. I want to go watch television. Its impolite to leave the table in the middle of a meal. So what am I supposed to do? Just sit here and watch you guys chew?! Ill miss my show! Your TV show isnt as important as spending some time together as a family. Well compromise. Ill go watch a sitcom family. In a minute youre going to discover the difference between those and real life.
05/07/94
My TV show is starting. Im missing my show! Im sure your instinct for survival will kick in shortly. Whats the big deal about dinner?! Why cant I go watch TV? Lots of people watch TV while they eat! Calvin dinner is the one time during the day that we set aside to be together and talk. Theres more to being a family than just living in the same house. We need to interact once in a while. We could all argue over what channel to watch. You know what I mean.
06/07/94
Ive missed half of my TV show now. I hope youre happy. You shouldnt be planning your life around the TV anyway. Hmph. Look I dont think its too much to ask that we sit together for 40 minutes without distractions and interruptions. RINNGG! Ill get it! Im expecting a call. Go ahead Dad. I believe you were saying something funny. I have all these great genes but theyre recessive. THATS the problem here.
07/07/94
Cmon Hobbes we have to go outside. We HAVE to? Yeah Dad wont let me watch TV. He says its summer its light late and I should go run around instead of sitting in front of the tube. Can you believe it?! What a dictator. How cruel it is to be forced to play. ILL show him. I refuse to have fun.
08/07/94
OK next well race to that tree over there. THIS race will determine the championship of the universe. Oh... wait. How long have we been out here? I dunno. An hour maybe. Really? Geez. Where does time go?! Hang on Ill be right back. IM NOT HAVING FUN!
09/07/94
Its getting dark Calvin. Time to come in and go to bed! But Hobbes and I were catching fireflies. Cant we stay out a little longer? Ha! First you didnt want to go out and now you dont want to come in! See by not watching TV you had more fun and now youll have memories of something real you DID instead of something fake you just WATCHED. Nothing spoils fun like finding out it builds character.
10/07/94
Did you know that nobody on our street sets an alarm clock in the morning? Shut up.
11/07/94
Hop in Hobbes! Were going to get rich! Oh no Im not getting into that box. I dont want to be transmogrified or duplicated or whatever. What? When the TOP is open its a time machine remember? Even worse. Oh dont be such a baby. The way you act youd think the dinosaur actually GOT us last time. Why it wasnt even a carnivore. I dont care. You and that box are plain bad news.
12/07/94
Too bad youre not going back to the jurassic with me. An opportunity like this doesnt come along every day you know. The less often the better is what I say. Were just going on a photo safari! When we come back with REAL dinosaur photos well get rich! You can drop the we stuff. Im not going. OK well I guess Ill have to eat all these great snacks myself then. Snacks? What kind of snacks? Are they GOOD snacks? How many snacks did you bring?? Never mind! You said youre not going.
13/07/94
I guess if we get to have snacks it would be OK to time travel. If theyre GOOD snacks I mean. Great! Put on your vortex goggles. The dial is set for 140 million years ago. So OFF WE GO-O-O! I have a question. Why dont we get younger as we go back in time and disappear as we pass the day we were born? Id explain it but theres a lot of math. I thought you got a D in math.
14/07/94
Is it time for snacks yet? Hobbes were travelling at light speed through an interdimensional continuum lapse! Wait till we land! OK Ill just inventory the snacks and record them for the journal. You COULD help me drive you know! If we miss our exit we could fly right into the big bang! What would happen then? Thered be no universe and probably now time! I think we should eat the snacks NOW. Sit still will you? Youll make me swerve.
15/07/94
Theres a diplodocus! Were in the jurassic! We made it! Ugh. I cant believe you wanted to come back here. Last time we didnt bring a camera. All we need is a few good dinosaur photos and well be rich when we get home. If we get in National Geographic maybe Ill get to meet some of those tigress babes they showed in the April issue! Yow wow! Those were females? Really I dont know how you can even tell the difference.
16/07/94
Hey! Theres a chance to get some pictures of some stegosaurs! See these photos will answer hundreds of questions about dinosaur anatomy and behavior! Paleontologists will pay through their nose to see these! Take a picture of this one. Hes smiling. Just a minute. Just a minute.
17/07/94
The big stupid ultrasaur takes a long drink... a VERY long drink! The ferocious allosaur is thirsty too! This means confrontation! ..ah heh heh... Fortunately this allosaur is the patient type. Dont make me smack you across the hall twerp.
18/07/94
Whats THIS ugly brute called? AN ALLOSAUR! Im right here. You dont need to shout. RUN! When we get back to the time machine throw him the snacks we packed! Maybe that will diver him while we take off! You can throw YOUR snacks. I might still want mine. Youre going to be a snack yourself! Get in! Get in!
19/07/94
Quick! Thow him the food! My sandwich had mustard. Is this one yours? Put on your vortex goggles! Were taking off! Eww this banana is mushy. He can have THIS. We did it! Were off! Here. Boy that was a close call. Bit it will be worth it when we get these pictures developed. Since I rescued your sandwich can I eat it?
20/07/94
Hey Mom guess where Hobbes and I have been! I SAW where you were. You were playing in a cardboard box out back. Nope! Thats just what it LOOKED like. We time travelled to the jurassic but we returned at the split second we left! Thats why it didnt look like we were gone! We saw lots of dinosaurs! Well youve had a productive morning then. Yeah. Will you take this film to be developed? Ill pay you back
21/07/94
Hobbes look! We got our pictures back from our jurassic trip! Oh boy! Lets see! Wow these came out good! Look at that apatosaur! Theres me! Theres me! Yes! Yes! Were RICH! Ha ha! Now we can get our own apartment! This dinosaur blinked. Ill buy a car too but since I cant drive for another decade well have to get a chauffeur. If we pay him he has to let us sit up front and beep the horn right?
22/07/94
Well Dad its too bad you werent any nicer to me all these years. Beg pardon? Yep I cant say Im particularly including to share my future millions with you. Here look. Dinosaurs? Hobbes and I went to the jurassic today and came back with these dramatic photographs! Were going to be rich. I didnt realize dinosaurs looked so small and plastic. HEY WHAT ARE YOU INSINUATING?!
23/07/94
Dad doesnt believe we went to the jurassic and took photographs of real dinosaurs. He says it looks like we just put my toy models in the yard and took pictures of THEM! He says our get-rich-quick scheme wont work. Huh! He said if we REALLY wanted to get some money hed pay us a dollar to pull weeds out of the front walk. Just a dollar? Of course I told him we didnt want the money THAT bad.
24/07/94
I hate Sundays. The day of is ruined by knowing Ive got to get ready for school tomorrow. Why dont we get your chores done NOW so we can enjoy the rest of the day without worry? Hmm... I hate to delay fun but maybe youre on to something. This will make the fun MORE fun. At last! We got everything bad out of the way! There you are. Its time for bed. See if I ever listen to YOU again! Never put the low priorities first.
25/07/94
A toast to us! To us! Best friends forever! Right! CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH
26/07/94
Hi Dad. I suppose youre wondering how youre doing in the polls. Not really. I think youll find THIS chart quite revealing. This line represents the Average Dad approval rating of 70%. This overlay shows YOUR approval rating at just under 10%! Household six-year-olds were polled on their favourite bedtimes. Watch on these successive overlays how your rating would improve with each hour later! See by midnight youre right up to normal! These findings suggest a logical course of action. How long do you spend making these charts?
27/07/94
My tiger it seems is running round nude. This fur coat must have made him perspire. It lies on the floor - should this be construed as a permanent change of attire? Perhaps he considers its colors passe or maybe it fit him too snug. Will he want it back? Should I put it away? Or use it right here as a rug? Z. I wonder when school starts.
28/07/94
People dont understand me. They dont realize Im a card-carrying genius. You have a card? Oh absolutely. See it says Calvin certified genius. Wow you have a certificate? Well not really but no one every checks those things. I just say its at the frame shop. Pretty smart. Im a genius. How did you emboss this card? With a screwdriver?
29/07/94
AAHH! How am I supposed to learn surgery if I cant dissect anything?
30/07/94
You know what cracks me up? Ants RUN everywhere! Its like they all think they have to be somehwere on time! See they never walk or poke along. They go everywhere at top speed! Isnt that silly? Cmon around back. Ill show you something else!
31/07/94
The center snaps the ball to the quarterback! No he doesnt? NO! Secretly hes the quarterback for the other team! He keeps the ball! A traitor! Calvin beaks for the goal! Whee! Hes at the 30... the 20... the 10! Nobody can catch him! Nobody WANTS to! Youre running toward your own goal! Huh?! When I learned you were a spy I switched goals this is YOUR goal and mines hidden! HIDDEN?! Youll never find it in a million years! I dont need to find it! As a traitor to your team crossing MY goal counts as crossing YOUR goal! Ah you might THINK so... In fact I KNOW so! But the place I hid MY goal is right on top of YOUR goal so the points will go to ME! But the fact is Im really a double agent! Im on your team after all which means youll LOSE points if I cross your goal! Ha ha! But IM a traitor too so Im really on YOUR team! I WANT you to cross my goal! The points will go to YOUR team which is really MY team! That would be true... IF I were a football player! You mean...? Im actually a badminton player DISGUISED as a double-agent football player!! And IM secretly a volleyball-croquet-polo player! Sooner or later all our games turn into Calvinball. No cheating!

With a distant rumbling great thunder clouds pile high into the sky! Suddenly theres a blinding flash of light! Its Calvin the lightning bolt! In a fraction of a second the house below will be in a million pieces! I know its raining out but play a board game or something.
02/08/94
Every day its the same old thing. ... but not today! Everybodys a slave to routine.
03/08/94
Can I get some contact lenses? Your eyes are fine! You dont need contacts. Yes I do! They have some that change the color of your eyes! Your eyes are very pretty the way they are. But if I had contacts I coul dmake one eye blood red and the other yellow striped like a bug. I dunno it seems like once people grow up they have no idea whats cool.
04/08/94
Geez I gotta have a REASON for everything?!
05/08/94
Boy when its THIS hot I dont want to do anything at all! Fortunately that was our plan from the start.
06/08/94
ME TARZAN! KING OF THE JUNGLE! THUMP THUMP. Nice underpants. Does your Mom know youre over here like this? I dont think Jane EVER said that to Tarzan.
07/08/94
The intrepid Spaceman Spiff is stranded on a distant planet! .. our hero ruefully acknowledges that this happens fairly frequently.. To survive Spiff must... ...find... food! Spiff follows a scavenger mordon! Perhaps theres a fresh kill nearby! Ughhh! The stench! Our hero becomes a vegetarian on the spot! But the grasses are indigestible! The fruit is poisonous! Theres nothing to eat at all! Weak and despairing Spiff peers into a frozen geyser pit! Whats down there? Ice cream sandwiches! Our hero is saved! Thats not very healthy. I only need to survive until I escape our hero mutters grimly.
08/08/94
Off to work eh Dad? Yep. It sure is a nice day. The kind of day just made for sitting under a tree and reading a good novel cover to cover dont you think? Too bad thats a luxury at your age. Well maybe you can do it when youre 65. Im sure youll be that old before you know it. Enjoy your day at work. Dad sure is surly in the mornings.
09/08/94
You know whats weird? I dont remember much of anything until I was three years old. Half of my life is a complete blank! I mustve been brainwashed! Good heavens what kind of sicko would brainwash an infant?! And what did I know that someone wanted me to forget?? Boy am I mysterious. I seem to recall you spent most of the time burping up.
10/08/94
MOM! Theres a big horsefly on the back of your head! Dont move! Ill get it! Ill get it! Is it still there? You didnt move did you? Get away from me!
11/08/94
Arr! Were bloodthirsty pirates! Avast ye scurvy dogs! Hoist the jolly roger and ready the plank! Here. Whats this? Our booty!
12/08/94
Hey Mom did you know that gravity in outer space works as if space was a soft flat surface? Its tru. Heavy matter like planets sinks into the surface and anything passing by like light will roll toward the dip in space made by the planet. Light is actually deflected by gravity! Amazing huh? And speaking of gravity I dropped a pitcher of lemonade on the kitchen floor when my roller skates slipped. How can kids know so much and still be so dumb?
13/08/94
You know. The world shouldve been designed so everyone didnt have to eat each other to survive. There should just be fewer people and animals to begin with. And the world certainly couldve used a more even distribution of its resources thats for sure. I wonder why nobody consulted you. Incredible isnt it?
14/08/94
The world isnt so bad if you can just get out in it.
15/08/94
Calvin the hummingbird zips by with a loud whir! Although small he puts out tremendous energy. To hover his wings beat hundreds of times each second! What fuels this incredible metabolism? Concentrated sugar water! He drinks half his weight a day! ... preferably loaded with caffeine. Are you drinking more soda pop?!
16/08/94
Once upon a time there was... Hold it. Whats the matter? Has this book been a best seller? Has the author won a Pulitzer? Did the New York Times like it? I only want stories that come highly recommended. Are there any laudatory quotes on the dust jacked? Ahem... Once upon a time there was a noisy kid who started going to go to bed without a story. Has this book been made into a movie? Could we be watching this on video?
17/08/94
What are you doing? Im practicing my sneers. Theres nothing like a good sneer to dry up conversation. Hows mine look? Awful! Thanks. With this sneer I hope to be an unbearable burden at any social occasion. That will give you a real head start on beeing a teen-ager. I know! Its like getting seven extra years!
18/08/94
WHAP! Too late! I made another home run. (pant pant) Im quitting if we dont stop using this tennis ball.
19/08/94
AAAGH!! You should be more alert! You wouldnt last two seconds in the jungle. THATS WHY I LIVE HERE YOU DOLT!
20/08/94
What are you doing down there Calvin? Shh Mom! Go away! Susies coming down the walk and Im going to throw some crab apples at her. Oh no youre not! Put those down! AWWW MOM! Dont throw crab apples at ANYone. Theyre hard and you could really hurt someone. OK OK. What are you doing there Calvin? Shh Susie! Go away! Im going to throw this squishy old tomato at my Mom.
21/08/94
I love fall. I like the cool days the smell of leaves the low sunlight... and the sky looks even more blue when the trees are yellow and red! I dunno... I think autumn is melancholy. Summer is over and in a week or two everything will be hunkered down for the long bleak winter. Nothing lasts. Fall is just the last fling before things get worse. If good things lasted forever would we appreciate how precious they are? I like to have everything so good I can take it all for granted. I think the brisk air makes apple pie taste better too! Mm-mm!
22/08/94
Do you support the free expression of ideas in our society? Sure. Thats first on our bill of rights. So you would be against censorship and suppression of ideas you found distasteful. Right. Youve got to take the bad with the good. So you wouldnt object to me being exposed to art movies or music that some people think is offensive and shocking right? OK first let me explain about our responsibility to be culturally educated and able to MAKE critical distinctions about... YOUR STALLLLING!
23/08/94
Hmmmm rub rub rub GRR SNARLL Hmmmm rub rub rub
24/08/94
Sometimes I feel like our life has gotten too complicated... that weve accumulated more than we really need... that weve accepted too many demands... Well Thoreau says Simplify Simplify. Maybe thats what we need to do. But how? I hate it when they look at me that way.
25/08/94
Hello? Hi Dad! Its me Calvin. Calvin unless this is REALLY important hang up OK? Im very busy. OK Dad. Goodbye. This should qualify in another 15 minutes.
26/08/94
Calvin I asked you to clean up your room. I DID! Well you didnt do a very good job then. It looks as messy as it did before. You should take pride in what you do and always do the best job possible. I dont need to do a better kob. I need better P.R. on the job I DO.
27/08/94
Huhh UHH! I wouldnt be worried about this if he was a better student.
28/08/94
My what an ugly tree? AAAGH. Where the heck did my leaf pile go?! It went back home! Dont you have anything bigger than a rake??
29/08/94
Mom wants me to make my bed. Come help me OK? OK. You get some pencils and Ill get some big paper! I thought we were making the bed. And do all that work?!? No were going to invent a robot to make the bed FOR us! Wont inventing a robot be more work than making the bed? Its only work if somebody makes you do it.
30/08/94
How are we going to invent a robot? We dont know anything about machines. Maybe YOU dont. Its easy. There are just four simple machines to alter force. The lever the pulley the inclined plane and um the internal combustion engine. Take my workd for it Im an expert at inventions. So where do we start? We ask Mom for a research grant.
31/08/94
Hi Mom. Can I look at your wallet for a few minutes? I uh want to see something. Hold on. Did you make your bed like I asked you? Im working on it. As I recall your bed is in your room. Im inventing a robot to make the bed but I need a grant. Can I have $50? Whatd she say? Did you get the money? Boy when were the cover story of popular mechanics Ill have some choice words to say about family encouragement.
01/09/94
OK the first thing our robot needs is a head. Should we use a coffee can? No thats too small. The head has to hold his tape recorder. See Ive made recordings for the robots voice! Really? Sure! This way our robot not only communicates but we can also program him to have the proper personality! Personality? Right. Robots should be RESPECTFUL. *click* How may I ease your life oh grand exalted master?
02/09/94
Hey Dad Im inventing a robot. Can you get me a patent? You invented a robot? Well here it is so far. Hobbes and I have been working on it all afternoon. Its not quite perfected yet but you get the idea. Hmm... what does it do? Thats the problem. We havent figured out how to make it do what we want. Dont get discouraged. Your Mom and I got the same results after working on YOU for six YEARS. Har har. My attorney is a comedian.
03/09/94
Well Hobbes we might as well give up. I cant figure out how to make a robot. This one doesnt do anything. Its past your bedtime Calvin. Youll have to leave your toys for tomorrow. OK Mom. Our robot wasnt working out anyway. Gosh and we spent all day on it too. I thought for sure our robot would save us from making the bed. And in a way he DID! Hey yeah! Were geniuses!
04/09/94
YAWWNN.
05/09/94
Your Mom sure was cheerful this morning. Hmph. Ive never seen her humming and sashaying around the kitchen like that. Hmph. How long have we been waiting for the bus now? About two and a half hours. I think Mom put me out here this early on PURPOSE.
06/09/94
Hi Calvin! Arent you excited about going to school? Look at all these great school supplies I got! I love having new notebooks and stuff! All IVE got to say is theyre not making ME learn any foreign languages! If English is good enough for ME then by golly its good enough for the REST of the world! Everyone should speak English or just shut up thats what I say! You should maybe check the chemical content of your breakfast cereal. They can make me go until grade eight and then FFFT Im outta here!
07/09/94
The fearless Spaceman Spiff is being pursued across the galaxy by dreaded scum beings! Theyre gaining! Spiffs only chance to lose them is to release a giant smoke cloud behind his spacecraft! Our hero throws the lever! Heh heh... just uh clapping the erasers heh heh... (cough) You again? *sighhhh* I cant believe its not even 8:30 yet.
08/09/94
I want that truck Twinky. Its mine Moe. I brought it from home. I said gimme the truck. Moe you cant just TAKE things from people just because youre bigger! Im not taking it. Youre GIVING it to me because well both be so much happier that way. How touching.
09/09/94
What a day. IM HO-O-AAAH! KAPOWWW!!! Things get so darn quiet when youre not around. Theres going to be some ruckus NOW buddy-boy!
10/09/94
Is it? It IS! Its SATURDAY! Oh boy! No school! No homework! Just cartoons and fun the whole day long! HOORAY! Turn on the TV! Get out the cereal! ITS SAAATURDAY! Youre getting up? Its barely light out! Im going to the office and get some sleep.
11/09/94
Im home! ...sighhhh... My life could stand a lot more pizzazz. Tell me about it.
12/09/94
Help me with this homework OK? Whats 6+3? 6+3 eh? Well this one is a bit tricky. First well call the answer Y as in Y do we care? Now Y may be a square number so well draw a sqare and make this side 6 and that side 3. Then well measure the diagonal. I dont remember the teacher explaining it like this. She probably doesnt know higher math. When you deal with high numbers you need higher math. But this diagonal is just a little under two. OK here Ill draw a bigger square.
13/09/94
Hey no comic books until you finish your homework. I DID finish. That didnt take very long. Did you do a good job? I did a GREAT job. When youre as far ahead of the class as I am it doesnt take much time. Well see about that when I get back from my parent-teacher conference with Miss Wormwood. Youre going to talk to my teacher? Im sure it will be an informative meeting. Gosh I forgot to tell you! Miss Wormwood said I was so good you didnt need to bother coming really! She said you dont have to go!
14/09/94
Oh man! Mom went to a parent-teacher conference! Im as good as dead. Miss Wormwood will tell Mom all sorts of horror stories about me! Horror stories? Well its a question of perspective. Still I think I should be allowed to have a lawyer present at the meeting. What are you going to say when your Mom gets back? Nothing. Nothing at all? Buddy if you think Im even going to BE here youre crazy!
15/09/94
Im home. How was your meeting with Calvins teacher? Well when we got to the classroom we saw that all the kids had drawn self-portraits in the art class and had left the pictures on their desks so the parents would recognize their childs seat. Thats a cute idea. Did you find Calvins picture? There was one drawing of a green kid with fangs six eyes and a finger up his nose. Uh oh. The meeting went downhill from there.
16/09/94
Calvin I... YIKE!! Youre home! I didnt even finish pack... that is um... LIES! Everything Miss Wormwood said about me was a lie! She just doesnt like me! She hates little boys! Its not MY fault! IM not to blame! She told you about the noodles right? It wasnt me! Nobody saw me! I was framed! I wouldnt do anything like that! Im innocent I tell you! What noodles? Oh... Uh... Ha ha! Did I say noodles? You must have heard wrong. I didnt say noodles.
17/09/94
OK Calvin lets check over your math homework. Lets not and say we did. Your teacher says you need to spend more time on it. Have a seat. More time?! I already spent ten whole minutes on it! Ten minutes shot! Wasted! Down the drain! Youve written here 8+4=7. Now you know thats not right. So I was off a little bit. Sue me. You cant ADD things and come out with LESS than what you started with! I can do that! Its a free country! Ive got my rights!
18/09/94
Now if it would only snow! While were waiting Ill draw more spirals above Susies head.
19/09/94
A small red spacecraft breaks through the cloud cover of Mysterio system planet 6! At the controls its none other than our fearless hero Spaceman Spiff! Piloting over the lifeless world he reflects on his unusual mission... QUIZ 1. 6+5= ... to somehoe crash planets 6 and 5 together!
20/09/94
In a scientific mission to discover what happens when two planets collide Spaceman Spiff drops anchor! The anchor catches on a hillside! Spiff downshifts and guns the motor! Imperceptibly at first the planet slowly moves towed along by our hero until... ...breaking orbit planet 6 picks up speed hurling towards planet 5!
21/09/94
Pulled by Spaceman Spiff planet 6 is about to collide with planet 5! With no time to lose our hero cuts loose the anchor and flies to safety! The planets crash grinding and shattering with awful force! Planet 5 being smaller is crunched to dust! Only 6 remains! 6+5=6. Time! Pass your papers forward. TIME?! I just finished the first problem!
22/09/94
How can our time be up?! I just did the first problem on this quiz! Where did the time go?? Guess! Guess! Pick random numbers! Maybe a few will be right by sheer luck! 15! 104! 3! 27! Hand it in Calvin. Your times up. SIGHHHH. Dont forget we have a bet on who gets the higher grade. The bets off! I dont gamble! No bets!
23/09/94
I got a perfect score on my quiz. You got a perfect score? What did YOU get? If you missed any you owe me 25 cents. I ran out of time! Id have had a perfect score too if Id had a few more minutes! What did you get? Its biological! Girls mature faster than boys! You just got a better grade because youre a girl! Its not fair! Pay up. Maybe its opposite day! Maybe all these Xs mean that my answers are correct! Maybe your A is really an F! That must be it! I win the bet!
24/09/94
How did you do on your math quiz? I flunked it... but only because I ran out of time. The worst part though was that Susie Derkins won our bet on whod get the better score. I had to pay her 25 cents. But get this! I cheated her! I only gave her three dimes! Ha! I think youre better study harded. Oh now dont YOU start on me.

Look Hobbes I cut a piece of cardboard to make a TV screen. See I just hold it up like Im on TV. Wow your own show! Too bad I cant really force my way into millions of peoples homes each day. But on the other hand no one ine THIS home can turn me off!
27/09/94
So whats it like being on TV? Its great! Now that Im on television Im different from everybody else! Im famous! Important! Since everyone knows me everything I do now is newsworthy. Im a cultural icon. I think your antenna needs adjusting. Watch Ill use my prestige to endorse a product!
28/09/94
Hi Im Calvin eminent television personality here to tell you about new improved Chocolate frosted sugar bombs! I love em! Theyre crunchy on the outside chewy on the inside and they dont have a single natural ingredient or essential vitamin to get in the way of that rich fudgy taste! Mm-mm! Yes kids youll like em so much you wont be able to sit still! Remember! Its the cereal I get paid to recommend because Im famous! What do you think? Are you filled with the desire to emulate me and eat the cereal I endorse? If not I can repeat this every 20 minutes. Dont you threaten ME.
29/09/94
Hi Mom! Ive got my own TV show! Thats nice. Hes Ca-a-alvin! Amazing great Ca-a-alvin! Oh hes the one that youd like to meet! Hes the one who just cant be beat! Hes ca-a-alvin! La data da daaaaa! Thank you! Thank you! Boy what an audience! Thank you! Please! Ha ha! No really sit down! Thank you! Thank you! Im changing the channel OK? Sorry Im on all the networks.
30/09/94
Wheres your TV screen? My fall lineup got cancelled. Dad said one TV in the house was bad enough and he preferred the one with the volume control. Maybe you should go cable. Ive got an idea for a sit-com called Father knows zilch.
01/10/94
What a rip-off! They say if you connect these dots you get a picture. But look! I did it and its just a big mess! I think youre supposed to connect them in the order that theyre numbered. Oh. Everythings gotta have rules rules rules!
02/10/94
Doesnt it seem like everybody just shouts at each other nowadays? I think its because conflict is drama. Drama is entertaining and entertainment is marketable. Finding consensus and common ground is dull! Nobody wants to watch a civilized discussion that acknowledges ambiguity and complexity. We want to see fireworks! We want the sense of solidarity and identity that comes from having our interests narrowed and exploited by like-minded zealots! Talk show hosts political candidates news programs special interest groups... they all become successful by reducing debates to the level of shouted rage. Nothing gets solved but were all entertained. Hmm you may be right. What a boring day THIS turned out to be.
03/10/94
33... 27... 18... HIKE! AUGHH! Its clear Ill never have a career in sports until I learn to suppress my survival instinct. Touchdown!
04/10/94
What this game needs are negotiated settlements.
05/10/94
How come YOURE the one who goes to work and not Mom? Well your Mom USED to go to work but once you came along someone had to stay home. Your Moms job had a lot of stress and aggravation see ... and she wanted to quit? No shed gotten used to it so we figured she should be the one to... HEY!
06/10/94
Get off the swing or Ill punch your lights out. What a sissy! Haw! Years from now when Im successful and happy ... and hes in prison... I home Im not too mature to gloat.
07/10/94
Give me a nice smile. Thats good. Now dont make a face OK? Ready? One... two... thre... click. Click. *click*
08/10/94
Oh great altar of passive entertainment... bestow upon my thy discordant images at such speed as to render linear thought impossible!
09/10/94
See any weirdness yet? How about this rock? It has a purple stripe. Hmm... I guess thats a LITTLE weird. Well look for something weirder. What do you think of this stick? Its a strange stick but not a weird stick. Its too bad there arent any good bugs out now. Yes bugs are usually weird. Hey heres a bird feather. Its pretty. But its not weird. A bald bird would be weird. I dont see one. Look! A ripped-up old kite! Some kid must have lost this last summer! Phooey. The string broke here. I was hoping wed find the kids skeleton up a tree at the other end. THAT would be weird. Well lets go in. Im cold. Me too. I guess some days weirdness is hard to find. My glasses are fogged and I cant blow my nose but my heart rate is the envy of men half my age! Weirdness always starts at home. Even when you look for it youre never prepared for it.
10/10/94
Here it is 8:00 and we have to go to bed already. Somebodys always running my life. I never get to do what I want to do. What would you do if you could stay up? I dunno... something FUN! Whatever Mom and Dad get to do!
11/10/94
That cloud of stars is our galaxy the milky way. Our solar system is on the edge of it. We hurl through an incomprehensible darkness. In cosmic terms we are subatomic particles in a grain on an infinite beach. I wonder whats on TV now.
12/10/94
Everyone takes me for granted! Nobody pays any attention to my needs! Is it too much to ask for an occassional token gesture of appreciation?! OK how about a big hug? Could I have 20 dollars? See?! I dont matter to anyone! Nobody cares about me!
13/10/94
Hobbes do you think our morality is defined by our actions or by whats in our hearts? I think our actions SHOW whats in our hearts. I RESENT THAT!
14/10/94
They say winning isnt everything and Ive decided to take their word for it.
15/10/94
I STAND FIRM IN MY BELIEF OF WHATS RIGHT! I REFUSE TO COMPROMISE MY PRINCIPLES! I dont NEED to compromise my principles because they dont have the slightest bearing on what happens to me anyway.
16/10/94
POW! Did you throw that snowball at me?! What snowball? Ohhhh. Dont play innocent with ME buster! That snowball had your name written all over it! Oh yeah?! Yeah! It was sneaky fiendish vicious treacherous grim and ruthless! Put all that together and it spells tiger! No it doesnt! It spells Calvins new name is Mr. Stupid Soggyshorts! Ooh THAT does it! Ow! Hey! Stop that! Quit it! Leggo! No fair! No biting! Hey Calvin you should have seen your expression when I hit you with that snowball! Ha ha! Ah hehh...
17/10/94
Have you seen my shoes? I thought I had them out right here. Your shoes? I dont know. They WERE right here. Where could they have gone? Were going to be late. Well I cant goe anywhere without my SHOES. Help me look. Theyre not leaving US behind with a baby sitter tonight!
18/10/94
DING DONG Its ROSALYN! Answer the door will you please Calvin? Hi Roz. My parents have changed their minds about going out so we wont be needing your services. Goodbye. Hi Rosalyn. What are you talking about Calvin? You cant go out if Mom cant find her shoes right? And what do YOU know about THAT? Uh nothing! Ha ha! Um why? Are her shoes missing? Id like to be paid in advance tonight.
19/10/94
Phooey. Mom and Dad left. Now were here alone with the baby sitter from the black lagoon. Hee hee! Do you think she remembers how last time we threatened to flush her science notes down the toilet? Ha ha ha! Our finest moment. OK you get in bed. WHAT?! Its not even 6:30! She remembers all right. She cant get away with this. Well call the rescue squad.
20/10/94
Rosalyn? What are you doing out of bed? I thought I heard something outside. I didnt hear anything. It was kind of a thump. Will you go look and make sure its not anything scary? Ill check but I didnt hear any thump. Yes... yes! Go out the door! Two more steps! Oh please oh please! Yes yes yes! See? Theres nothing out here.
21/10/94
See Calvin? Theres nothing out here. But I KNOW I heard something! Go look OK? Please? OK if it will make you feel... HEY! SLAM THIS WAS A TRICK?! WHY YOU SNEAKY LITTLE DROP ILL GET YOU!! Hobbes! I locked her out! Now we can watch TV and eat cookies till were SICK! Oh boy! This is the best weve EVER been baby sat!
22/10/94
CALVIN WILL YOU LET ME BACK IN THE HOUSE THIS INSTANT! Dont worry Rosalyn! Theres only a 50% chance of rain tonight! Ha ha! Shes trying to open the downstairs windows. Its OK. I already locked them up. YOU OPEN UP THAT DOOR! Hey Roz! Whats in your purse? Mind if we look??
23/10/94
Lets try this path over here! I dont see a path. Well MAKE a path! Huh boy. Change is invigorating! If you dont accept new challenges you become complacent and lazy! Your life atrophies! New experiences lead to new questions and new solutions! Change forces us to experiment and adapt! Thats how we learn and grow! Whoops... well HEREs a fresh challenge. Ill admit its opened up new horizons. The problem with new experiences is that theyre rarely the ones you choose. I feel smarter already.
24/10/94
CALVIN IM TELLING YOUR PARENTS ABOUT THIS! NOW LET ME IN! Pipe down will ya Roz? Hobbes and I can hardly hear the TV! Youre not supposed to BE watching television! Hey if you go rent us a VCR and a mobie well put the TV near a window so you can watch too! LET ME IN! Are you 18? You could get us Venusian Vampire Vixens!
25/10/94
CALVIN! Hang on Roz. The phone is ringing! I hope its your parents! I hope they ask to talk to me! Boy youll be in trouble THEN! Its your boyfriend Charlie! Should I tell him that youre indisposed? Ha ha! No! LET ME TALK TO HIM! Say chas dont you think youre settling for too little in the girlfriend department?
26/10/94
Isnt it great to get out of the house alone together for a change? Its so nice and quiet. We should do this more often. CALVIN YOUVE GOT FIVE SECONDS TO OPEN THE DOOR BEFORE I BREAK A WINDOW! Im telling you Chuck your girlfriend is a psycho! I hope youre not makingany long-range plans around her.
27/10/94
Wow this is fun! All the TV shows were not allowed to watch and a bag of cookies each! SLAM! Hey what was that? AAUGH!! ROSALYN! H-how did YOU g-get in?? *gulp* whoops I think its past my bedtime.
28/10/94
It was all a misunderstanding! An innocent mistake! Let me explain! Calvin listen closely. Locking Rosalyn out of the house wasnt just MEAN it was DANGEROUS. If youd hurt yourself or if there was a fire she wouldnt have been able to help you. You go apologize to Rosalyn right now. I-Im sorry Rosalyn. And were sorry too. I PROMISE you Calvin will behave himself next time. An extra five would help there BE a next time.
29/10/94
Boy did I get in trouble. Stealing Moms shoes and making Mom and Dad late... then locking the baby sitter out of the house... whoof. Thats a lot to live down for just one evening. I feel pretty bad. And having eaten a whole package of Oreos doesnt help. You said it.
30/10/94
Wow it really snowed last night! Isnt it wonderful? Everything familiar has disappeared! The world looks brand new! A new year... a fresh clean start! Its like having a big white sheet of paper to draw on! A day full of possibilities! Its a magical world Hobbes old buddy... ...lets go exploring!
31/10/94
Another gorgeous brisk fall day. What a waste to be going to school on a morning like this? What would you do if you could stay home this morning? Sleep right through it.
01/11/94
WHOA WHOAA WHOOOP BONK AHHHH! OOH! It COULDVE happened by accident!
02/11/94
Dont sit next to me Calvin. I dont want to hear any disgusting comments about lunch. Relax. I wont talk about lunch at all. Instead do you want to hear a riddle I made up? A riddle? OK. Whats the difference between a garden slug and a two-inch-long living booger? EWW!! I cant think of a difference either.
03/11/94
Get off the swing Twinky. Forget it Moe. Wait your turn. PUNCH! Its hard to be religious when certain people are never incinerated by bolts of lightning.
04/11/94
IM HOME! Theres no point in saving your lunch bags if you cant keep them cleaner than THIS! Thats what YOU think.
05/11/94
... tranquil Mt. Calvin... Suddenly with a shaking rumble he blows sky high! Hes a live volcano! Geysers of molten lava spray into the heavens! I TOLD you that chili sauce was hot! GLUG GLUG GLUG Yechh he spewed it all across the table!
06/11/94
Outrage! Why should I go to bed? Im not tired! Its only 7:30! This is tyranny! Im ZZZZ Good night Calvin. Will you check for monsters under the bed? No monsters. Youre safe. What about the dresser? Calvin Im sure there are no monsters in your dresser. Go to sleep. Great. Ill bet thats where they all are. Theyll come out and kill us as soon as we fall asleep. So whos going to fall asleep? Well well just have to get the monsters first. You irritate them with this horn and Ill nail em with my dart gun when they come out. Get ready! I hear one coming! Whats all the noise?! AAIEEE!! A monster in the hallway!! Dear will you come up here a minute? I think I wounded him. Give me the bat and Ill finish him off!

Hi Susie. What did you bring for lunch today? A swiss cheese and ketchup sandwich. Its my very favorite too. So I dont want to hear what gross thing YOU brought. Relax Susie. I bought cafeteria lunch today. Good. It appears to be cigar butts in a gallstone sauce. Thats beany-wienies! Really? Oh gross.
08/11/94
Hello? Hi Dad. Its me Calvin. Youre supposed to be at school! I AM at school. Are you all right? Whats the matter? Why are you calling? I told the teacher I had to go to the bathroom. Quick whats 11+7?
09/11/94
I was reading about how countless species are being pushed toward extinction by mans destruction of forests. Sometimes I think the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact us.
10/11/94
What are you DOING?! Youre going to be late for school! Hurry up and put your clothes on right. Its sad how some people cant handle a little variety.
11/11/94
I wonder why man was put on earth. Whats our purpose? Why are we here? Tiger food.
12/11/94
Z Z SNAP A little high-strung are we? We tigers all it lightning quick reflexes
13/11/94
No! goodness what was all that fuss? Oh Calvin didnt want to take his bath. What a noisy kid! Im doomed. I cant believe my own parents would do this to me! AH-HA! Ive got you now kid! AAUGH! Help! Quick! Momm! HA HA HA! Have a drink! Hellp! Gurgle blub. Calvin! Quiet down and quit splashing! I dont want to have to clean the whole bathroom. Ha! I pulled the plug! Down the drain with you! Die fiend! Die die!! Dont tell me hes letting out the water already! Believe it lady.
14/11/94
Hello is your Dad there? No he isnt. OK will you write down my number and have him call me? Hold on. I need a pen. POW! AGHH! Ive been shot! I hate taking messages.
15/11/94
Mom do we have a shoe box I could have? Its for a school project. I think so. Lets see. Heres one. What are you going to do with it? Im supposed to make a diorama. Were studying the different ecosystems and Im going to make a desert scene. That sounds interesting. Ill need some glue and paper and stuff too. Im going to build a cactus and a roadrunner. When is this due? It was due today but I told the teacher I wasnt quite finished.
16/11/94
Wow Mom sure turned into the conniption queen when she found out I hadnt neve started my diorama project when it was already due today. So this is one day late! Whats the big deal?! Its not as if LIVES hang in the balance right? The fate of the universe doesnt depend on turning in a shoe box desert scene on time! Thats keeping things in perspective. Even if lives DID hang in the balance it would depend on whose they were.
17/11/94
This is hopeless! How am I supposed to create a desert scene in this shoe box when I dont even know what a desert looks like? IVE never been to a desert. Mom and Dad never take me anywhere fun on vacations! If theyd taken me to a desert sometime Id KNOW this stuff! Why dont you get out a book? And go to all that TROUBLE?! Yeah sure! Look Im a busy guy! Ive got other things to do with my life besides THIS you know! Right. Why waste time learning when ignorance is instantaneous? My TV show starts in 20 minutes. Are you going to help me or ont?
18/11/94
Mom where do we keep the papier-mache? We dont have any. Oh great! Just GREAT! How am I supposed to make a roadrunner without papier-mache?! Maybe you should have thought of that before 7:00 at night. Youll have to make one some other way. BUT HOW?! This is YOUR school project Calvin. YOU do the work. If I get a bad grade itll be YOUR fault for not doing the work for me!
19/11/94
Hows the diorama coming along? Im almost finished. That didnt take too long. Thats because Im a genius. I dont see the roadrunner. Werent you going to put one in? See the cotton balls I glued down? Yeah? The roadrunner just ran out of the scene leveing those clouds of dust!
20/11/94
Our hero the valiant Spaceman Spiff is marooned on a strange world ... Ill set my Mertilizer on deep fat fry. Calvin! Youre not paying attention! ... we join Spaceman Spiff on the distant planet Zorg ... Gronk! Argh! Trapped by a hideous Graknil Spiff draws his trusty atomic napalm neutralizer! Chew electric death snarling cur! But the weapon is useless! Spiff is doomed!! Our hero makes a break and ducks into a nearby cave! Weeoo! Whats that awful smell? Eep! Who was that? Beats me Fred.
21/11/94
Youve never had an obligation an assignment or a deadline in all your life! You have no responsibilities at all! It must be nice! Wipe that insolent smirk off your face! The real fun of living wisely is that you get to be smug about it.
22/11/94
I hate doing this stuff! Its too much work. Why should I bother? Until you can stalk and overrun you cant devour anyone. I can see why tiger aphorisms dont catch on.
23/11/94
Live for the moment is MY motto. You never know how long youve got! You could step into the road tomorrow and WHAM - you get hit by a cement truck! Then youd be sorry you put off your pleasures! Thats why I say Live for the moment. Whats YOUR motto? Look down the road.
24/11/94
Ive decided I dont want to be famous. No? Nah. ANY idiot can be famous. I figure IM more the LEGENDARY type! Uh huh. Well I didnt mean right this second!
25/11/94
Can we burn these leaves? No that pollutes. But how can we appease the mighty snow demons if we dont sacrifice any leaves?! Well have a warm winter. I dont know whether your grasp of theology or meteorology is the more appalling. I guess Ill go light some candles around the toboggan and beg for mercy.
26/11/94
Do you think tigers go to the same heaven that people go to? I mean in heaven everyone is supposed to be HAPPY right? But people wouldnt be happy if they were always in danger of being eaten by tigers! On the other hand heaven wouldnt be very nice WITHOUT tigers either. I wouldnt be happy if there werent any tigers. Id miss them. Maybe tigers just dont eat people in heaven. But then WE wouldnt be happy.
27/11/94
We join our hero Megazorks above the planet Gloob ... Spaceman Spiff conqueror of the cosmos is pursued by the hideous scum beings of planet Q-13! Spiff hyper-freem drive malfunctions! The aliens close in! suddenly a searing bolt of deadly fram ray slices across the blackness! Our hero is unfazed. Another bolt! Spiff is hit!! Spiff is going down can he make it?? Is this the end?!? AAAAAA Spiffs alive! He made it!! Im alive! Ha ha ha! I kiss the sweet ground! Maybe you should play on the swings Calvin.
28/11/94
Hey Dad Ill guess any number youre thinking of! Go ahead and pick a number! Mm... OK Ive got it. Is it 92376051? By golly it is! Wait a minute! Youre just trying to get RID of me arent you?! No youre psychic. Go show Mom.
29/11/94
A lot of people dont have principles but I do! Im a highly principled person! I live according to one principle and never deviate from it. Whats your principle? Look out for number one.
30/11/94
Mom you know the sandwich you packed for me today? Well by lunch time the jelly had soaked into the bread. That grosses me out. So tomorrow Id like the jelly put in a separate container with a knife so I can spread the jelly at the last possible moment before I eat the sandwich. Also you keep using the bread from the middle of the loaf. I only like those pieces for toast. For sandwiches I want only the end pieces because they dont absorb as much jelly. Got it? Doggone it she did it again!
01/12/94
Why look! You made your bed without even being told to! Thats wonderful Calvin! Gee your Mom sure is nice when you help her. Yeah thats the reason I usually dont. I like Mom to be impressed when I fulfill the least of my obligations.
02/12/94
Look out of the window! Its snowing! Theres must be almost half an inch! By morning Ill bet theres tons of snow! Do you think the schools will close?? What? OH YEAH? WELL SAME TO YOU!! I wonder how a crabby guy like him got to be superintendent.
03/12/94
That was quite a ride. Ill say. Ive never seen a sled catch fire before. Were lucky the pond hadnt frozen.
04/12/94
There! Our fortress is completely indestructible! Sunny and warmer today high in the upper thirties ... Our snow fort is impenetrable! At the slightest provocation well let loose a merciless barrage of stinging ice!! None dare attack us! We rule all!! Together a veritable fist of defiance we stand immune to any onslaught! We are invincible!! We ... uh ... umm ... piff!
05/12/94
Watching a Christmas special? Yep. Another show extolling love and peace interrupted every seven minutes by commercials extolling greed and waste. I hate to think what youre learning from this. Im learning I nee my own TV so I can watch someplace else.
06/12/94
Im writing my Christmas list Hobbes. Should I add anything for you? Hmm... I cant think of anything. NOTHING?! You dont want anything at ALL?!? Ive got a good home and a best friend. What more could a tiger want? It must be sad being a species with so little imagination.
07/12/94
Thanks for helping me mail my letter to Santa. It sure was heavy. Those big envelopes hold only a couple hundred pages. Thats why I used a box. I hope Santa doesnt throw his back out when he gets it. All I can say is THIS year Santa had better bring everything on my list! Ive been extremely good all year! What about the noodle incident? NO ONE CAN PROVE I DID THAT!!
08/12/94
This whole business of Santa rewarding GOOD kids and neglecting BAD kids really bugs me. ... not that I have anything to worry about of course. A paragon of virtue thats you. Right! But see there are certain things a GOOD kid could do that might look BAD in a certain light if one didnt consider all the mitigating circumstances. Like keeping an incontenent toad in your Moms sweater drawer? Exactly. If I was being raised in a better environment I wouldnt do things like that.
09/12/94
I think if Santa is going to judge my behaviour over the last yeaer I ought to be entitled to legal representation. I mean lets face it a lot of Christmas loot is at stake here and the constitution says no person should be deprived of property without due process of law. So you can be my lawyer OK? Its easy! Me?? Sure! Heres a legal bad! Youre all set! OK but I dont take pro bono cases.
10/12/94
OK Hobbes as my lawyer youll need to review the facts of my case. Right. Well try to establish that you were insane at the time of the alleged crimes. Were not copping an INSANITY plea you moron! Were saying Im INNOCENT! Insulting an attorney is a penal offense so watch it buster. Youre supposed to argue that I havent been bad this year and I deserve to be on Santas good list! If THATs our case I advise you to settle out of court. In a minute you and I are going to settle this out of DOORS.
11/12/94
Very grim Calvin. Youre still having oatmeal. Gurgle. Quit playing with your oatmeal and eat it Calvin. Gagpth! Im free! Bugh! Yaah! Death to oatmeal! Youll never escape vile glop! Die! Die! Calvin! Quit! ... oh no ... Its your fault we didnt have a sweet little girl! Your stupid chromosome!! Not mine!! ... I just live here.
12/12/94
When are we going to get a Christmas tree? Oh I dunno. Probably a little after New Years. AFTER NEW YEAR?? Sure. We can just go up the street and pick the best tree from the neighbors driveways. WHAT?! Sometimes theres still tinsel on the tree too so you dont even have to decorate it! Well save time AND money! OK what did your Dad tell you THIS time?
13/12/94
Yes Calvin? You have a question? Yeah I was wondering if we could stop the lesson here and adjourn to the playground for the rest of the day. Of course not. Now then lets all turn to page 24 and... Miss Wormwood? YES? How about just ME then?
14/12/94
For Show and Tell today I have something that will astound and amaze you! This little guy can... Have you all had your shots?
15/12/94
Are there any monsters under my bed tonight? Of course not. Come under and see for yourself. Yeah come and see. Heh heh heh. Oh right! You think Im falling for THAT?! Who am I TALKING to if there arent monsters down there?! Umm.. Uh.. Theyre all teeth and digestive tract. No brains at all. Why were dust balls! Yeah LITTLE dust balls!
16/12/94
EWW! Whats THIS disgusting stuff?! Its spider pie. You can pick out the legs and give them to your Dad if theyre too hairy for you. S-s-spider p-pie? Why I believe were going to have a quiet dinner for once. I know I dont feel like opening my mouth. Hey I LIKE it!
17/12/94
Want to go play outside? No its too much trouble. FIRST Id have to get up. THEN Id have to put on a coat. THEN Id have to find my hat and put IT on. (sigh) Then wed run around and Id get tired and when we came in Id have to take all that stuff off. No way. So what are you going to do instead? Im just going to sit here and wait for a good TV show to come on. Ill tell your Mom to turn you toward the light and water you periodically. Instead of making smart remarks you could get me the remote control.
18/12/94
I love winter days. Theyre so peaceful. Ha ha! Gotcha Susie! Hey you dummy! Youll never be able to throw a snow ball that big! Ha! Stupid girl! Hey what are you doing? Get away. Hey! Put me down! Where are you taking me?! Hey! Hey! Chunk.
19/12/94
Want to help me write a book? Sure. Whats it about? Well you know what historical fiction is? This is sort of like that. Im writing a fictional autobiography. Its the story of my life but with a lot of parts completely made up. Why would you make up your own life? Because in my book I have a flame thrower!
20/12/94
Still and quiet feline form in the sun asleep and warm. His tail is limp his whiskers drooped Man what could make this cat so pooped? Sheeshh...
21/12/94
Hi Mom! Im making my own newspaper to report the events of our household. Thats nice. Now Im looking for a page one lead story. Can I interview you? Sure. OK what are you cutting up there for dinner? Fish. Knife wielding mother hacks ichthyoid! Grim melee is evening ritual! Suburban family decours victim! Out of the kitchen! Out! Out!
22/12/94
Hi Dad. Im making my own newspaper to report the events of our household. Would you help me out? Sure what do you need? Well you can take your pick. Either you can give me 15 bucks to pay my labor and production costs... 15 bucks?! ... Or you can be the subjedt of a comic strip called Dopey Dad. So in the next panel Dopey Dad yells Its bed time for YOU young man! Hee Hee! Look how big I made his mouth!
23/12/94
Ooh hahh ooh hahh ooh hahh ooh hahh I wish wed ged ad aquariub!
24/12/94
What story would you like tonight Calvin? Hamster Huey and the gooey Kablooie! Oh no not again! Thats what you hear EVERY night! Lets read something different! I WANT HAMSTER HUEY! I WANT HAMSTER HUEY! Cmon well read a new story tonight. Youll like it I promise. No I wont! Ill stay awake until morning if you dont read Hamster Huey! I didnt remember Hamster Huey having quite that starcastic tone of voice. Or doing everthing so FAST.
25/12/94
OK boys have we loaded everything? Ah theres still the matter of this Calvin sir. His list is 30 pages long not including the supplement about incendiary weapons. The research dept. thought you should handle this one personally. Well is he naughty or nice? Ah a bit problematic chief... heres his dossier. Ohhh yes the noodle incident kid... That was a while ago boss. he says he was framed and weve had trouble verifying the particulars. Accounts seem to vary. What about all these slushballs thrown at the girl down the street? My my my! No dispute there. Surveillance documents some 400 incidents but the kid claims extenuating circumstances. Hmm... dont they all. A tiger vouches for the kids character... says the kid tries to be sort of good if hes not tempted otherwise. What do his parents say? Heres the Dads comments. Were looking into the sarcasm factor. all right. Ive made up my mind. Is the boy asleep yet? Ah no. Hes wide awake. Santa wont come until were asleep you know. I CANT TAKE THE SUSPENSE!
26/12/94
WUMP!
27/12/94
ANY dumb kid can build a snowman but it takes a genius like me to create ART. This snow sculpture transcends corporeal likeness to epxress deeper truths about the human condition! This sculpture is about grief and suffering! One look at the tortured countenance of this figure confirms that the artist has drunk deeply from the cup of life! This work shall endure and inspire future generations!
28/12/94
Still making snow art? Yep! Yesterday your sculpture melted. This time Im taking advantage of my mediums impermanence... This sculpture is about transcience. As this figure melts it invites the viewer to contemplate the evanescence of life. This piece speaks to the horror of our own mortality! Hey stupid! Its too warm to build a snowman! What a dope! Ha ha ha ha! A philistine on the sidewalk. Genius is never understood in its own time.
29/12/94
Hows your snow art progressing? Ive moved into abstraction! Ah. This piece is about the inadequacy of traditional imagery and symbols to convey meaning in todays world. By abandoning representationalism Im free to express myself with pure form. Specific interpretation gives way to a more visceral response. I notice your oeuvre is monochromatic. Well cmon its just snow.
30/12/94
Dad if you threw a snowball at someone but deliberately missed would that be bad? Well I suppose that would be provoking so yes it would be a little bad. As bad as if youd hit the person? No not THAT bad but worse than if you hadnt thrown it at all. Suppose you just GRAZED the person. How bad would that be? Say maybe you knocked off his hat and his glasses or something. That would mean instant death.
31/12/94
Boys this pudding was great! Can I take a bowl upstairs to Hobbes? No I think youve had enough. I didnt say for ME. I said for HOBBES! Well I dont think Hobbes needs any either. WHY NOT?! Um... Because tigers need to stay lean and mean. Thats what she said. Im lean! Im mean! Tell her chocolate pudding makes my coat lustrous.
01/01/95
Im home from school! So I gathered. Hobbes? Yaaaaah! Aaaaugh! Tiger attack! Calvin! Quit crashing around! Hobbes jumped me Mom! I was fighting for my very survival!! Sure Calvin. Look I dont want to sew Hobbes up again so why dont you two go do something quiet? Okay okay ... You sissy. Mom always takes your side! Thats because she wanted another tiger not you!
02/01/95
How are you doing on your New Years resolutions? I didnt make any. See in order to improve oneself one must have some idea of whats good. That implies certain values. But as we all know values are relative. Every system of belief is equally valid and we need to tolerate diversity. Virtue isnt better than vice. Its just different. I dont know if I can tolerate that much tolerance. I refuse to be victimized by notions of virtuous behavior.
03/01/95
No! No! No! I need more sleep! I c-cant keep m-my eyes open! Bed?! Already?? But Im wide awake!! My internal clock is on Tokyo time.
04/01/95
I sure am great! Im one of the greatest people who ever lived! How lucky people are to know someone as great as me! Im great in so many ways! In fact Im so great that my greatness is... Youre not great! Youre the most conceited blowhard Ive ever met! When youre great people often mistake candor fo bragging.
05/01/95
Here Ill hang up your coat. Thanks. If youve been looking for Hobbes he somehow got put in the closet. I just found him way back in there. Waiting for me in the CLOSET eh? Too bad your little plan was THWARTED!! Why dont you hang up your coat yourself?!
06/01/95
Oh yeah? Define well-adjusted.
07/01/95
Why does man create? Is it mans purpose on Earth to express himself to bring form to thought and to discover meaning in experience? Or is it just something to do when hes bored?
08/01/95
It says here that Religion is the opiate of the masses. ... what do you suppose that means? ... it means Karl Marx hadnt seen anything yet. What are you watching? Garbage. This show would insult a 6-year-old! And I should know. So why watch it? All the other shows are even worse! Why watch TV at all then? Theres nothing to do. Nothing to do?! You could read a book! Or write a letter! Or take a walk! When youre old youll wish you had more than memories of this tripe to look back on. Undoubtedly.
09/01/95
1. Explain Newtons First Law of Motion in your own words. Yakka foob mog. Grug pubbawup zink wattoom gazork. Chumble spuzz. I love loopholes.
10/01/95
Im ready for anything! Are you ready for unconditional surrender? That above all else.
11/01/95
BRBBBBRBBBB. Their tummies shouldnt be so soft and fuzzy if youre not allowed to do that.
12/01/95
... and so with nothing left to life for he obeys the chanted command from the distant crowd below.
13/01/95
Next on Eyewitness action news: blood-spattered sidewalks and shroud-covered bodies! Could the next victim be YOU?? Well get the story from the sobbing hysterical relatives and well tell you why YOU should be paralyzed with helpless fear! Thats Eyewitness action news! Its what YOU need to KNOW!
14/01/95
When I grow up Im going to be a scientist. Ill dedicate my career to the proposition that man can reshape the Universe according to his own whims. Ill probably go into genetic engineering and create new life forms. You want to play God? Not exactly. God never bothered to patent his stuff.
15/01/95
McZargalds ... next exit ... 50 Megazorks. Over 7Million earthlingburgers served. Spaceman Spiff is going down!!! We join our hero as he struggles to land his damaged spacecraft! The altitude flaps refuse to respond but fearless Spiff is unfazed! Spiff careens through the alien canyon! Is this the end?? No! moments before impact Spiff ejects! Now are you through charging around the house or are you going to fall down the stairs again? Our hero regains consciousness at the feet of a sarcastic alien ...
16/01/95
Some days you get up and you already know that things arent going to go well. Theyre the type of days when you should just give in put your pajamas back on make some hot chocolate and read comic books in bed with the covers up until the world looks more encouraging. Of course they never let you do that. Is today one of those days? IT SURE IS!!
17/01/95
On gray days when its snowing or raining I think you should be able to call up a judge and take an oath that youll just read a good book all day and hed allow you to stay home. So youd only go to school on sunny days? Well no on sunny days he judge would let you play outside. Hes quite a guy. Hed make you go to school if it was hot hazy and humid with a lot of bugs.
18/01/95
Pssst! Whats 7+6? Three hundred billion gazillion. Oh thanks for the big help! Thats a three followed by 85 zeroes. Ah! I knew that.
19/01/95
Im thinking of starting my own talk radio show. Ill spout simplistic opinions for hours on end ridicule anyone who disagrees with me and generally foster divisiveness cynicism and a lower level of public dialog! It would seem you were born for the job. Imagine getting PAID to act like a six-year-old!
20/01/95
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh Oh boy Oh boy Oh boy HA HA HA HA HA HA. Obviously Ive tapped into some primeval well of the human psyche.
21/01/95
Snow sharks? That guys a goner.
22/01/95
What should we have Dad read us tonight? ... so in the next panel Supertoad goes Plooie and ... My what big teeth you have! Said little Red Riding Hood. The better to eat you with! Said the wolf ... tiger ... said the tiger and he pounced on Little Red Riding Hood. Just then a hunter came by and when he saw the wolf ... tiger ... when he saw the tiger he picked up his gun and ... and? ...and it was too late. The tiger ate them both and he lived happily ever after. The end. Good story Dad! Thanks! Sniff. I always cry at happy endings.
23/01/95
Look at my new invention Dad! I unraveled a hanger and poked it out the back of my pants to make a tailhook! Now with a rope stretched across the doorway I can blast into a room at top speed and the hook will grab the rope and stop me before I crash out the window on the opposite wall! Well? Dont just sit there man! Get out some patent applications! I wonder how many fortunes hes let slip through his fingers.
24/01/95
As an artist Ill speak to future generations long after Im gone! Smart thinking. I call this Nude descending a staircase.
25/01/95
Everything is so darn hard! I wish I could just take a pill to be perfect and I wish I could just push a button to have anything I want. The American dream lives on. Why should I have to WORK for everything?! Its like saying I dont deserve it!
26/01/95
Look its almost 11 oclock! Wow the last two hours really flew by! I hope the teacher didnt say anything important.
27/01/95
Outta my way Twinky. ...and suddenly the Earth opened up! Wailing helplessly Moe tumbled head over heels down the smoking chasm until he splashed into the molten magma at the planets core where he slowly melted before igniting in a spitting fireball of grease!
28/01/95
How in the world did you get in to the bathroom and back out so fast?
29/01/95
Man the harpoons! Thar she blows!! Can Hobbes take a bath too? No Hobbes doesnt need one. Hold still. By golly what if I drown because nobody was here to rescue me?? Hobbes! Cmere! Mom cant know youre in here okay? Ill disguise myself with bubbles. Hmm ... you need a hat. Hang on and Ill get one of Dads. I like his gray one the best. Maybe you should wear a tie too. Ill be right back. Better hurry! I think I hear your mom coming! Dear! Why are you taking a bath?!? ... and wearing your best hat!!
30/01/95
In two seconds every kid in the lunchroom is going to wish HED thought of putting snow in his thermos.
31/01/95
Ahem. WAA! I HATE I JUST HATE RETRACTABLE CLAWS!! So are you through reading this?
01/02/95
CALVIN!
02/02/95
If a groundhog sees his shadow today well have six more weeks of winter. So yell if you see one.
03/02/95
Tiger sprawling in the sun! Fast asleep his day is done. Lying here twas warmth he sought. The sun has made his tummy hot. One sad fact he overlooked: his brain is now completely cooked!
04/02/95
Dad says theres nothing cozier than a fire but I dunno...
05/02/95
Hey Calvin! Are we near a slaughterhouse or did you forget your deodorant?! Drop dead Susie! Youre so ugly I hear your mom puts a bag over your head before she kisses you goodnight!! Its shameless the way we flirt. Whats it like to fall in love? Well ... say the object of your affection walks by ... yeah? First your heart falls into your stomach and splashes your innards. All the moisture makes you sweat profusely. This condensation shorts the circuits to your brain and you get all woozy. When your brain burns out altogether your mouth disengages and you bable like a cretin until she leaves. Thats love?!? Medically speaking. Heck that happened to me once but I figured it was cooties!!
06/02/95
One of my baby teeth came out. I have to say Im not entirely comfortable holding a piece of my own head.
07/02/95
Mom says the tooth fairy might give me 50 cents for this tooth. Wow! So I got an idea. poured plaster over this tooth to make a mold and now Im casting duplicate teeth. Ill put one under the pillow every night and by the end of the year Ill have over 150 dollars! Do you think the tooth fairy will believe your mouth had 300 teeth in it? If shed rather have an old tooth than 50 cents how bright can she be?
08/02/95
Look at this hilarious cartoon I drew! See this snowman is in a snow car and he says Darn it the engine froze up! Ha ha ha ha! Get it?? But if the car is made of snow the engine would MELT if it wasnt frozen. Either way it wouldnt run.
09/02/95
As I have created you so I can destroy you! Therefore in recognition of my supreme power you must worship me! Yes bow before the mighty Calvin and tremble for I am the eternal all knowing... PAFF
10/02/95
PIFF. I didnt do it! I never threw that! You cant prove I threw it! Besides I MISSED didnt I? The defendant petitions the court for a new trial on the grounds that his lawyer is incompetent.
11/02/95
Hello? Is your mother there? Whos calling?? Is this about ME?! cause if it is I didnt DO it! You got NOTHING on me understand?! You cant prove ANYthing! I tell you Im innocent! Just give up! Youll never get me! Oh here Mom its for you. Hi can I call you back? Go ahead and talk. I cleared it. Its cool.
12/02/95
Hey Mom can I drive now? No. How about now? Oh no! oh you stupid car! Whats wrong with you now?!? Thats it Mom! Go ahead and swear! We dont mind! Calvin be quiet! Want Hobbes and me to go get help? You stay where you are. Ill look under the hood. Kick the car Mom! It works on the TV! Look at all these cars going by. Nobodys stopping to help. Lets blow the horn! Maybe someone will come. Beeeep! Hoorayy!! Someone stopped! Were heroes!! Want me to call a tow truck lady? First call the police and report an infanticide.
13/02/95
Mmm... somebodys having a fire. I love the smell of a fire on a cold winter day. Isnt it strange how smells are so evocative but we cant describe them. Oh I dunno. That fire has a snorky brambish smell. I should have known animals would have words for smells. Its a little brunky but low humidity affects that.
14/02/95
Youre telling me that animals have their own words for specific smells? Well sure. OK whats the word for how wet leaves smell? Snippid. Whats the word for how I smell? Terrible. Woo hoo hoo hoo hoo.
15/02/95
Graphic violence in the media. Does it glamorize violence? Sure. Does it desensitize us to violence? Of course. Does it help us tolerate violence? You bet. Does it stunt our empathy for our fellow beings? Heck yes. Does it CAUSE violence? ... well thats hard to prove. The trick is to ask the right question.
16/02/95
Most people dont know what its like to be a child prodigy so thats why Im writing my autobiography. Does your magnanimity know no bounds? Genius has its obligations. Hey how do you spell boogers?
17/02/95
I no longer wish to be called a boy. Isnt that what you are? Yes. But I find that term demeaning and sexist. What do you want to be called then? A chromosomally advantaged youth. That may not catch on.
18/02/95
Ahh what could be better than a Saturday 6-mile run at dawn in 20-degree weather... ...followed by a big bowl of gummy oatmeal and some dry toast! How about some dried-up prunes and a root canal? Dried prunes! Do we hasve some??
19/02/95
Aachoo! Gesundheit! Okay! How many monsters are under my bed tonight? Just one. Thats good Hobbes! We outnumber him! Hee hee! Wanna get him? Yeah! See if you can reach the baseball bat! Heh heh! Quit shoving you hogs! Mommmmm! Nice going Maurice.
20/02/95
With sheer brain power I will force this sled to carry me up the hill! But until I decide to do that Ill walk!
21/02/95
I wonder why people are never content with what they have. Are you kidding? Your fingernails are a joke youve got no fangs you cant see at night your pink hides are ridiculous your reflexes are nil and you dont even have tails! Of course people arent content! Forget I ever said anything. Now if TIGERS werent content that would be something to wonder about.
22/02/95
I like homework. I dont want to go outside. I want to do math problems. BLEHHH. My brain always rejects attitude transplants.
23/02/95
Look at how people are portrayed in comic strips. The women are indecisive whiners nagging shrews and bimbos. And the men are no better. Theyre befuddled morons heavy drinkers gluttons and lazy goof-offs! Everyone is incompetent unappreciated and unsuccessful! What kind of insiduous social programming IS this?! No wonder the worlds such a mess! I demand politically correct morally uplifting models in the funnies! Yes we all know how funny good role models are. And look all the kids are obnoxious brats!
24/02/95
Wouldnt it be cool if you sneezed and the spray from your nose instantly froze? You could break it off your face and have a 3-D sculpture of your sneeze! ... Well I think it would be cool. People wonder why cats are solitary.
25/02/95
CALVIN STOP RUNNING THROUGH THE HOUSE! The law is on the books but it would take all their resources to enforce it. CALVIN!
26/02/95
How can I get some money? Short of earning it I mean. I want a gernade launcher mom. Whens Christmas? Not for a long time. Whens my birthday? Not for a long time. Whens my allowance? You spent it already. Do I have any stocks I can cash? War bonds?? Calvin Im trying to work! Can I borrow some soap? Yes you can borrow some soap. Have all the soap you want.
27/02/95
VROOOOMM BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP SPLUTCHH. Ack! Not so much! Not so much! I hate this stuff! Pipe down and eat.
28/02/95
What happened in Concord in 1775? Lets be honest. Youre asking me about Concord? I rely on the bus driver to find my own house from here. Concord could be on Neptune for all I know. And what happened 220 years ago?? Im a kid. I dont know whats going on NOW. I dont have a shred of context for any of this. Its hopeless Miss Wormwood hopeless. We both try to demoralize each other.
01/03/95
Look Hobbes this is my retirement fund. A comic book? This is the issue where they introduce the arch-villain Deathmeister! In a few years a rare mint copy of this will be worth millions of dollars! Needless to say I bought five copies sealed them in airtight plastic bags and put them in a box in the closet where the light and humidity wont affect their precious pages! How will these be rare and valuable if every kid in America has five copies? Were all counting on the other guys Mom to throw them away.
02/03/95
If I had a computer Im sure Id get better grades on my book reports. Youd still have to read the book and tell the computer what you want to say you know. Man whats all the fuss about computers?!
03/03/95
Want to buy my latest invention? What is it? Its a writers block! You put it on your desk and you cant write there any more! I must be years ahead of my time.
04/03/95
Whats the matter honey? You look down in the dumps. I dont have a hairy chest. Mom says some babes dont care. Thptpbt! Right.
05/03/95
Ready? Let me check what the deductible is on my insurance policy ... Munch munch. Would you care for a soft drink? Ok. H-H-here y-you a-a-are! Any desert? No thanks. Well be landing shortly. The captain has turned off the seat belt sign. Thank you for choosing Calvins flight 240 non-stop to Stoney Gulch. Next time I wont take the dinner flight.
06/03/95
Sometimes all that feline dignity is just too much to keep up.
07/03/95
Today for Show and Tell I refuse to show you what I brought and I refuse to tell you anything about it! Its a mystery that will haunt you all your miserable lives! Youll never EVER know what I brought! You can beg and plead but Ill never end your torment! Ill carry my secret to the grave! Its the show and tell that was never shown or told! Ha ha ha! AH HA HA HA HA! Everybody wants the same old thing.
08/03/95
Cigars are all the rage Dad. You should smoke cigars! Flatulence could be all the rage but it would still be disgusting. I see. Nicely put dear.
09/03/95
A box of new crayons! Now theyre all pointy lined up in order bright and perfect! Soon theyll be a bunch of ground-down rounded indistinguishable stumps missing their wrappers and smudged with other colors. Sometimes life seems unbearably tragic.
10/03/95
OK thats plenty of television. Turn it off. Ill mope and whine and argue! Ill get in the way! Ill get in trouble! Ill tear around! You wont have a moments peace if you make me turn off the TV! I noticed she had to think about it.
11/03/95
Hello? Yes Id like to speak with the chief of police. Hello chief? Is it a LAW that your socks have to match anything else youre wearing? HEY MOM LISTEN TO THIS!
12/03/95
How come we play war and not peace? Too few role models. Ill be the fearless American defender of liberty and democracy ... and you can be the loathsome godless communist oppressor. Were at war so if you get hit with a dart youre dead and the other side wins ok? Gotcha. Go! Wap Wap Kind of a stupid game isnt it?
13/03/95
Watcha doin? Looking for frogs. How come? I must obey the inscrutable exhortations of my soul. Ah but of course. My mandate also includes weird bugs.
14/03/95
I am not scared of this ball. AAA! AAA! AA!
15/03/95
You just struck out for the next five innings. But it didnt get me!
16/03/95
I think angels are everywhere. You do? Theyre on calendars books greeting cards... almost every product imaginable. What a spiritual age we live in.
17/03/95
I like to set kites free.
18/03/95
Sometimes when Im talking my words cant keep up with my thoughts. I wonder why we can think faster than we can speak. Probably so we can think twice.
19/03/95
Did you ask your Mom if you could jump off the roof? Questions I know the answers to I dont need to ask right? Is this blanket big enough? Perfect! See Ill just grab all the corners and make a parachute! You can watch as I float to the ground gently as a leaf. Geronimo!! Crunch! His Moms going to have a fit about those rose bushes.
20/03/95
FREE! Ha ha! This walk goes to MY house. I know that.
21/03/95
YOUR house is over there. Want me to draw you a map of how to get there? Obviously Im not GOING to my house. Its a lot MORE obvious that youre not coming to MY house! I have to stay here until my Mom gets home. WHAT?! Says who?? My Mom and your Mom! You think I made this up? You think I want to be here?? Well its my Moms rule that you can sit in our yard but you cant come in the house. Your Mom didnt say that!
22/03/95
Let me in! Your Mom said I could stay here! No! Go away! You can wait in a tree! Im telling! HELLO? HELLO? CALVIN WONT LET ME IN! AAUGH! shh! shhh! OK OK! In fact heh heh heh why dont you go in ahead of me? I just remembered a big orange surprise waiting for you! Dont be scared! Yeah Im trembling. Ill just step way way back here!
23/03/95
Is this your big orange surprise? Doggone it Hobbes! Didnt you pounce?! Heres your tiger. He was by the door. WHATS WITH THE TIE?! Hello Susie. Come on in. My Mom didnt call and say I could go home yet did she? YOU DRESSED UP FOR A GIRL??!
24/03/95
Would you care for a snack Susie? Um OK. Thank you. Well? What have you got to say for yourself? When one entertains female friends one should try not to look quite as seedy as certain unnamed parties habitually do. Whos entertaining?! Whos a female friend? Who looks seedy?! A spotted tie is just the thing when youre wearing stripes! Tigers have a natual flair for causal chic! I cant believe this. Why didnt you kill her when she came in the door?! By the way if you had made proper introductions we might have smooched her hand. Here let me adjust the narrow end of your tie about eight inches.
25/03/95
What happened to YOU? Hobbes and I had a frank exchange of ideas. What are you doing? Homework?? I wasnt sure I understood this chapter so I reviewed my notes from the last chapter and now Im rereading this. You do all that WORK?! Well now I understand it. Huh! I used to think you were smart.
26/03/95
What do you have for lunch Susie? Maybe Ill trade you. Ugh! A cross section of a dachshund. No thanks. Its bologna! I wonder what I have for lunch today. Its lunch time! Ha ha ha! I think Ill have this little kid!! Help! Im being eaten alive by my own lunch! Somebody get me a fork! Hes got me!! Aaarrrgghh! Wham wham wham! Ha! I killed it with my thermos! See? Its bleeding jelly! No wonder this seat wasnt taken.
27/03/95
Wheres Susie? Shes in the living room doing her homework. NOW? Shes not putting it off until bedtime? She says she needs to get it done so she can practice the piano when she goes home! Wow its like science fiction or something. The Gender from Outer Space!
28/03/95
This emergency meeting of the Get Rid Of Slimy girlS club will come to order. Dictator-for-life Calvin presiding! Oyez! Oyez! As were all aware the enemy has infiltrated our territory and is spreading disinformatio to the effect that homework ought to be done right after school! As my Mom may have covert girl sympathies we must eradicate the hostile forces! Any questions? Yes could we poke some air holes in here? Too risky. The box of secrecy must remain secure!
29/03/95
OK we both understand the secret plan? Got it. But what about a secret code? A secret code? This secret plan doesnt need a secret code. Ahem. Section IV Article 12: Every secret plan needs a secret code. A. The more complicated the better. B. Everybody already knows pig latin. C. Phrases like code blue are cool. Our club charter never lies. Thats why this is such a great club.
30/03/95
Hey! I cant get out! Im stuck! Help! Calvin? Susie Im trapped in the hall closet! Open the door! let me out! Help! Help! Hurry! Quick! Im in the closet! Open the door and get me out of... SLAM HEY! YES!
31/03/95
Calvin are you slamming doors?! It wasnt me Mom! I didnt hear anything! LET ME OUT OF HERE CALVIN YOU ROTTEN BAG OF BARF! Whee! Our clubs finest hour! Wheres Susie? Beats me. Maybe she went outside. IM IN HERE! LET ME OUT! Why Susie? What were YOU doing in the closet of all places? He tricked me in there and held the door! Calvin...
01/04/95
Susie your Mom just called and shes walking over to pick you up. Finally! Ill talk you YOU in a few minutes upstairs. Bye Susie! Dont lock yourself in any more closets! We got rid of a slimy girl! What a great day of grossness! This goes in the log book! Id say some promotions awards medals and advanced degrees are in order! Should we get them before we get in trouble or after?
02/04/95
Hey Dad remember our car? Why sure. Wait a minute. What do you mean Remember? Hobbes I have a conjectural moral question. Maybe you can help. Sure. Suppose I did something bad. Should I tell Dad? How bad are we supposing? Well hypothetically lets say pretty bad. Like to his car hypothetically. How bad hypothetically to his car? Well lets pretend it was real bad. Should we pretend it could be fixed? If we imagined he could find the car we could pretend it might be fixed. I see. You can keep the book. Ill call the bus station. Que pasa senorita? I am el fugitivo!
03/04/95
Any monsters under my bed tonight? Maybe maybe not. You mean definitely yes? We didnt say that. WE? I mean I. ..uh.. that is if there were any of me. Shut up Winslow. Luckily for me monsters dont think clearly when theyre hungry.
04/04/95
We dont value craftsmanship any more! All we value is ruthless efficiency and I say we deny our own humanity that way! Without an appreciation for grace and beauty theres no pleasure in having them! Our lives are made drearier rather than richer! How can a person take pride in his work when skill and care are considered luxuries! Were not machines! We have a human need for craftsmanship! You had two days to write that paper. Two days?! Two days is NOTHING!
05/04/95
Its hard to know whats important in life. We dont notice the small stuff and were never prepared for the big stuff. What about the stuf in between? That stuffs boring. Lets hope bumbling along without a clue is important. According to the ads fresh breath and dry armpits are crucial.'
06/04/95
Can I get a drink of water? All right but hurry up. What are YOU doing home?! I prefer OUR water.
07/04/95
This bad grade is lowering my self-esteem! Then you should work harder so you dont get bad grades. Your denial of my victimhood is lowering my self-esteem!
08/04/95
Im the decisive take-charge type! Im a natural leader! See well go THIS way! Have fun. The problem is that nobody wants to go where I want to lead them.
09/04/95
Oops! I forgot to read chapter five for school tomorrow. What are you going to do? Catch a quick cold. Cough cough. You sound terrible Calvin. Ill get you some cough medicine. It wasnt me coughing. It was Hobbes. Me? It wasnt me! I know but that cough syrup tastes awful. So youre going to have me take it? Nothing doing buster. I refuse! Here you go Calvin. Open up. Not me! Give it to Hobbes! Hes the one who ... Gloomp Ackthp! Pbthbbppth!! Hack Hack. Mmm! That cough medicine is good! You should try some! Really! Youre not fooling me one bit you stinker.
10/04/95
What was the significance of the Erie Canal? In the cosmic sense probably nil. We big picture people rarely become historians.
11/04/95
Remember when I was first born? I couldnt even turn myself over! My eyes wouldnt focus! I couldnt do anything! Think of all the work it took to develop the motor skills necessary to hold a crayon top place the tip of it on a page and to move it in predetermined coordinated motions! This picture is the result of six years unrelenting toil! A lifetime of effort went into this! Im still not paying you $500 for it. It will appreciate! Its an investment!
12/04/95
Calvin? Calvin! CALVIN! AAUGH! Sorry. My eyes were on screen saver.
13/04/95
Right here! Put it here! AAAA! Lets work on your underhand pitches. If you keep running away like that you wont catch any fouls.
14/04/95
Calvin are you chewing gum in class? Yeth. Do you have enough to share with everybody? Probably. But do you really think theyd want it?? It was HER idea...
15/04/95
Ahem. Hi. Whats the point of wearing your favorite rocketship underpants if nobody ever asks to see em?
16/04/95
Im taking the umbrella outside. Well thats showing a little foresight for once. Good for you. Wait a minute. You really think this will work? Of course! Lets go! Smash! Bonk bonk bonk. Look! Im flying!! I had my eyes shut. How was it? Great! What a ride! Lets get some other kids and charge em!
17/04/95
I think I should stay home from school. Ive got a sore throat an ear ache a stomach ache Im seeing spots and Im dizzy. Ill call the doctor. Hold on I think its all clearing up! Yes. I think Im better now. Its pretty hard to hit that magic number of appropriately vague mildly serious but not quite worrisome symptoms.
18/04/95
What a pretty sky today! Its too blue. It needs some red. Red? Just a little right over there. Hang on. Thats better. Well Ill be!
19/04/95
Ah! I got the letter I wrote to myself! What did you write? Dear Calvin Hi! Im writing this on Monday. What day is it now? How are things going? Your pal Calvin. My past self is corresponding with my future self. Too bad you cant write back.
20/04/95
I got another letter from my past self. Whats it say? Dear future Calvin I wrote this several days before you will receive it. Youve done things I havent done. Youve seen things I havent seen. You know things I dont know. You lucky dog! Your pal Calvin. Sniff. I feel so sorry for myself two days ago. Poor him. He wasnt you.
21/04/95
Lets draw the line at the umbrella.
22/04/95
I hate all this wind! Boy this is unpleasant! Stupid miserable wind! What a lousy weather! What an awful day! Well if you cant change it whats the point of griping about it? Im not going to let a little wind be more annoying than me.
23/04/95
Honey we have to leave soon. Is Calvin taking his bath? Oh good. While Im taking my bath you can brush your teeth and comb your hair. Right. Your dad wont mind if I use his cologne will he? Well go easy this time. Think I should shave? No go for the Don Johnson fuzzy look. Heres a tie and one of my sport coats. Perfect! Right out of GQ! boy I look good in anything dont I? Refresh my memory. How did I get talked into this one? My friend would like to see the wine list.
24/04/95
This new issue of Chewing magazine tells how to set up a mandibular fitness regime! Basically they recommend interval training: chewing one piece of gum with lots of reps followed by chewing five pieces of gum at once so you can really work the masseter and buccinator muscles. Its a gruelling workout but you build strength AND endurance so you can come through in a clincher. Im sure the glory makes it all worthwhile. Plus you develop that chewers jaw that drives the girls wild.
25/04/95
Whats with the face? Im doing stretches. Chewing magazine says you should always warm up before you chew gum. Did you know that neglecting to stretch the temporalis muscles is the leading cause of gum chewing injuries? What about falling down while chewing and walking? With a good helmet the risk is surprisingly small.
26/04/95
In this issue Chewing reviews the new gum chewing apparel. This jersey is makde with Swet-Tek (R) fibers that wick away perspiration! The mesh collar keeps your sternomastoids ventilated and the zippered pockets hold spare gum and wrappers! Why is it covered with brand logos? That gives you the psychological edge of pretending youre sponsored. How can you tell if youre reading an advertisement a product review or the product itself? ID sure like to be a walking endorsement.
27/04/95
I need to get a heart rate monitor. What for? To make sure Im chewing at my aerobic threshold! Every day I want to see that Im chewing more gum faster harder and longer! Whats the point of attaching a number to everything you do? If your numbers go up it means youre having more fun. Sciece to the spirits rescue once again.
28/04/95
WHAT ON EARTH AM I DOING HERE ON THIS BEAUTIFUL DAY?! THIS IS THE ONLY LIFE IVE GOT!! AAAAAAA. Next time try a drink of water and a few deep breaths.
29/04/95
Look! A trickle of water running through some dirt! Id say our afternoon just got booked solid!
30/04/95
Wanna go catch some fish? Sure. Ugh. I dont want to touch these worms will you put one on my hook? Me? Im not gonna spear any worms. I know ... lets just dump the worms in the water and when the fish come up to eat them well catch them in the net! Pretty smart huh? Thats what I like about surviving in the wild ... pitting our wits against the raging elements! The worms are getting soggy. Ooh they are starting to sink. Bloop bloop bloop. Lets pit our wits against some fast food cheesburgers. Those come in neat little boxes. Yeah whod want to eat something that eats worms anyway?
01/05/95
I suppose the secret to happiness is learning to appreciate the moment. I for example take great pleasure in being right here right now doing what were doing. Of course youre supposed to be at school. I couldnt appreciate those moments.
02/05/95
Why arent we hooked up to an on-line service so we can connect to other computers? Its bad enough we have a telephone. HELLLPPP!!
03/05/95
I hate when a lot of kids are on the slide. You wait forever to get to the top and then the ride is over so fast. And if you sit for a moment to enjoy the height everybody yells at you to get going. And sometimes the idiot behind you starts down too soon and he smacks into you at the bottom before you can get away. Yep the playground is a LOT more fun after the class starts. CALVIN!
04/05/95
PHOOMPP. Why are you crying? Im cutting up an onion. It must be hard to cook if you anthropomorphize your vegetables.
05/05/95
Calvin would you demonstrate the next problem at the board? Yes Miss Worm-wood. I would be hap-py to do an-y-thing you ask. I have been suc-cess-ful-ly pro-grammed to obey all di-rect-tives. I have no will of my own... my own... my own... my own. Doesnt anybody appreciate theater?!
06/05/95
Can I run the vacuum cleaner? No not until youre older. Im old enough! I could do it! Well maybe just this once if you do a real good job. That suppressed smile worries me.
07/05/95
Weve got a baby sitter tonight. Ready? Ready. Calvin the baby sitter is here! Were going! Be good ok? Hi there. You must be Calvin. Hmmph. Youre not my mom. So I dont have to do anything you say. Im going to do whatever I feel like so just stay out of the way. Calvin take a look by the telephone and tell me what you see. A note Mom left with emergency numbers. Right. Now you wouldnt want me to have to call any of those numbers would you? Well. It must be 6:30. Guess Ill turn in. for eight bucks a night I dont put up with much.
08/05/95
Please excuse Calvin from class today. His genius is urgently required on a top secret matter of national security. Sincerely The President of the United States. P.S. Really. Nice try. Sit down. I gotta learn how to write in cursive.
09/05/95
How come grown-ups dont go out to play? Grown-ups can only justify playing outside by calling it exercise doing it when theyd rather not and keeping records to quantify their performance. That sounds like a job. ...except you dont get paid. So play is worse than work? Being a grown-up is tough.
10/05/95
A big part of life is boring routine. I need more excitement. So today Im going to have a new kind of cereal. This cereal doesnt have any chocolate frosting. It has fiber and raisins. Of course a bit part of life is horryifying surprise. Routines can be comforting. We tigers prefer to inflict excitement on others.
11/05/95
15 people in line and the teller goes on break without a replacement. After I wait ten minutes they open a new line for all the people behind me who have waited TWO minutes. Im waiting to pay and the cashier puts ME on hold instead of the person on the telephone. Have a nice day. Too late.
12/05/95
Have you noticed how nobody dresses up for anything anymore? People look like slobs wherever they go. Everybodys rude too. People swear all the time and you can forget about being addressed as Mr. or Sir. Theres no respect for anyone. How come I gotta change the world?!
13/05/95
Every Saturday morning is the same. We get up at the crack of dawn watch cartoons and eat sugary cereal until we fight and then Mom throws us out of the house. It never changes. Thats what I like about Saturdays too! First one downstairs get to pick the cartoons!
14/05/95
Look it says you have to be eighteen to buy cigarettes. Eighteen?!? By then Ill know better! Mom can I have a cigarette? Sure Calvin. I think your grandfater left some here. Just smoke outside ok? Wow! Your mom let you have a cigarette? For a mom sometimes shes pretty cool. Eeeeeep. Blaaugh! Gag. Hack. Cough. Youd think this would be an easy habit to break. Wheeze! Well now ... did we learn a little lesson today? Gasp. Yes. Trusting parents can be hazardous to your health.
15/05/95
WHACK. AAA!! What are you scared of? The balls not going to bit you. How do YOU know?
16/05/95
AA! AA! AA! AA! What do you mean you want a glove for the other hand too? Which word dont you understand?
17/05/95
AAA! CLOMP! How often have I told Calvin not to leave his stuff in the yard?!
18/05/95
Have you been hitting rocks with this bat? No why? Look at it. Its chewed up. You should take care of your equipment. The ball did this! Its what Ive been trying to tell you! These are fang marks! That ball is berserk! Its deranged! Its a menace! Why do I even bother?
19/05/95
PHOOOOFF. Wow! Look at the size of that one! bip. Secretly I was hoping for a deafening explosion.
20/05/95
FFOOOOFF. FFOOOOF. bip.
21/05/95
Whats that smell? Either moms cooking dinner or somebody got sick in the furnace duct. Boy does it stink in here! What are you cooking for dinner?! Whatever it is Im not eating it. Im stewing some monkey heads. Monkey heads? Theyll be soggy enough to eat in about twenty minutes. Really?? Were having monkey heads! We are not ... are those really monkey heads? Ive never had monkey heads before! I wonder what theyre like. Wow! Monkey heads! Mm ... kinda squishy. Oow look is that a nose? Whats this? Brains? I didnt think theyd be so rubbery ... what? I thought these were stuffed peppers. Honey. What the heck is this?? Whatever it is Im not eating it!
22/05/95
Aackkk. Ch... ch... ch... chocolate ch-chips... no. And get up off the floor. urgle.
23/05/95
Im a great believer in the value of novelty. I say anything NEW is GOOD by definition! It can shock insult or offend me so long as it doesnt bore me! If you cant give me something new then repackage the old so it LOOKS new! Novelty is all that matters! I wont pay attention if its not fresh and different! I see why timeless truth doesnt sell. Give me a good flash in the pan any day.
24/05/95
YAWWNN. YAWWNN. YYAWNN. YAWWNN. One of us should have left the room.
25/05/95
When I was a kid my Mom would take me to the big old department store downtown and I used to love riding the escalators. The escalators there had wood stairs and they used to click clack and creak. The wood slats on each step were maybe half an inch apart and I always wondered if ladies got their high heels stuck and got pulled under. Some of those escalators were very narrow - just wide enough for one person. Yep those old escalators had a lot more personality than these slick metal ones. Id hate to think that all my current experiences will someday become stories with no point.
26/05/95
Mmf. Rrgg. One! REWARD PLEASE!
27/05/95
Giving is better than having. When you GET something its new and exciting when you HAVE something you take it for granted and its boring. But everything you GET turns into something you HAVE. Thats why you always need to get new things. I feel like Im in some stockholders dream. Waste and want thats my motto.
28/05/95
No Earthling has ever before seen the cratered scarred surface of the distant planet Zog! ... although its not unlike some of those zit cream commercials ... we join the fearless Spaceman Spiff interplanetary explorer extraordinaire out at the farthest reaches of the galaxy ... with nerves of steel our hero sets forth on his dangerous mission! He fires his hyper-jets and ... blasts into the fifth dimension! Into a world beyond human comprehension! Into a world where time has no meaning! Man this class lasts forever! So we carry the three into the tens column ...
29/05/95
I heard that Miss Wormwood isnt here today. Really? Can we go home? Of course not. We have a substitute teacher. Can I send in a substitute student?
30/05/95
Whos our substitute teacher? Do you know? Mr. Kneecapper. Oh NO! Really? I heard he killed a kid last year! What?! Yeah some kid was talking in class so Mr. Kneecapper took him out in the hall and there were strange lumps in the cafeteria meatloaf that afternoon! OHH! Wait till she sees whats on todays lunch menu.
31/05/95
Things I will never like: 1. Drying off with a cold damp towel. 2. The feeling of seaweed wrapping around my leg. 3. Anything that was popular in the 70s. 4. Licorice yams or raisins. 5. That high-pitched screech that babies make. 6. Writhing maggots. Its comforting to know that there are certainties in life.
01/06/95
Life is full of possibilities. For example right now instead of waiting for the school bus I could stick out my thumb hitch a ride and spend the rest of my life in the Serengeti migrating with the wildebeests! The Serengeti is in Africa. You couldnt really hitch a ride there. Life is full of precluded possibilities.
02/06/95
Slurrpp. Sluurrp. AACKKPTH URGK BLUB! Id bet anything that the principal has a valve in his office that changes the water pressure.
03/06/95
Why are you digging a hole? Im looking for buried treasure! What have you found? A few dirty rocks a weird root and some disgusting grubs. On your first try?? Theres treasure everywhere!
04/06/95
Wap! Thok! Poom. Wunk. Nice double play. Whos out? It depends are you on my team or am I on your team?
05/06/95
Boy our family would sure be in trouble if YOU were bringing home the bacon! I AM NOT BACON!
06/06/95
Ouchywawa. Ive got a big owwy boo boo on my pinky. Thats too bad. When your ailments sound cute you dont get much sympathy.
07/06/95
When birds burp it must taste like bugs. Nobody ever pays me a penny for my thoughts.
08/06/95
Look at this Hobbes. I added it up and figured out I spend an average of four days a year taking baths! Four full days - morning noon and night - just sitting in the bathtub! What could possibly be a bigger waste of time than that?! How long did it take you to add this all up?
09/06/95
Wow! Look at this bug go! What on earth would make a bug hurry? Youre deluding yourself stupid! Nothing you do is important! Youre just a bug! Oh my gosh look at the time!
10/06/95
Im a man of few words. Maybe if you read more youd have a larger vocabulary.
11/06/95
Calvin quit horsing around! Hobbes is crowding me. This is my half of the seat. Got it stripeypants? That is your side! You stay over there! I see that!! Calvin Im trying to concentrate be quiet. Hobbes poked me. I dont care what Hobbes did! Just be quiet until we get out of this traffic. Hee hee! Stop it you heard Dad! Hoo hoo! Gkpthb! Were going to get in trouble. Mmp mp! Hee hee! Hee hoo ha hee ha ha! Calvin! I thought I said I wanted it quiet!! We were having a weird face contest Dad. But were all through now. You won.
12/06/95
Its hot its humid its buggy theres no breeze and the air is full of pollen. But its SUMMER!
13/06/95
Hey ant youre working like a maniac and what have you got to show for it? Whats the colony done for YOU lately? What about YOUR needs? You dont owe anybody anything! Let the others fend for themselves! Move out! Discover yourself! Express your individuality! If they listen this should solve our ant problem.
14/06/95
Hello? It surrrrre is nice outside! Climb a tree! Goof off! *click* Dad harrasses me with HIS values so I harass him with mine.
15/06/95
Look! I caught a butterfly! If people could put rainbows in zoos theyd do it.
16/06/95
AAAAAAA. Youre awake? Oh boy! Lets go! N-no c-coffee f-for m-me th-thanks. Hehh hoo hehh
17/06/95
Why does ice float? Because its cold. Ice wants to get warm so it goes on top of liquids in order to be nearer to the sun. Is that true? Look it up and find out. I should just look stuff up in the first place. You can learn a lot talking to me.
18/06/95
We should make Dad a Fathers day card. Okay Ill draw a picture of him on it. Hmm...make his mouth bigger. He usually look angrier than that. Good morning Dad! Happy Fathers day! Mmf. In appreciation of your service as dad. Today I am living according to the principles of your fatherly wisdom. Calvin what time is ... five in the morning?! Yes Early to bed early to rise. You always say ... I was going to buy you a nice present but A penny saved is a penny earned as you say ... so Im now earning 6% on the money I didnt spend. Yes Dad. Thanks to you Im a happier better person. Good work Socrates. I knew wed made a mistake the minute I saw that little bologna loaf in the hospital basement.
19/06/95
I cleaned and oiled your bicycle Calvin. What do you say I take some time and help you learn how to ride it? NOOOOOO!! Youre welcome. Mom! Mom! Dad HATES me!
20/06/95
Ive got the bike Calvin. Its not going anywhere. I can feel its going to throw me! Get ready to yank its wheels off! Just relax. Ive got you. How can I relax? Im uninsured and unarmed! Im as good as head! Push back on the pedals. Thats your brake OK? Yes well that was fun! Thanks for the lesson! Get back here. No really I think Ive got it! You can sell the bike now.
21/06/95
The trick to balancing is to have a little forward momentum. AAA! No momentum! No momentum! Just pedal slowly. Im holding the bike so you wont fall. Youll let go and the bike will launch me into the ionosphere! Trust me OK? TRUST you? I hardly KNOW you! Im your father!? What for six years?! When Im 40 well see how things are going along!
22/06/95
Look Calvin youve got to relax a little. Your balance will be better if youre loose. I cant help it! Imminent death makes me tense! I admit it! You need a goal. Concentrate on your goal. My goal is to dismantle this bicycle and mail every piece to a different country so it can never be rebuilt! OK thats not a good goal. WELL IM NOT CHANGING IT!
23/06/95
Think about the places you can go once you learn how to ride! AAAAA. Think about how impressed your friends will be! Think about how much fun youll have! AAAAAAA. AAAAAAAAAA. Think about inhaling. EEEP ahhh...
24/06/95
Ooh it doesnt look like the bike lesson went so good. It didnt. Dad LIKES riding his bike! He doesnt understand what its like for me! I HATE flipping over the bars getting chased around the yard and getting mowed down by a demonic machine! Is that what happened? No I tripped coming up the stairs.
25/06/95
Hobbes. You didnt bring your swim trunks here to the beach! No I prefer furry dipping. Yaaaaayy! Ow ow ow hot hot hot hot! Aaaaaahhhhh! Sploop splop. Brrrrrr! Cold cold cold. Ow ow ow hot hot hot hot hot. Dont tell me we drove an hour and a half for this!
26/06/95
Darn ol rain.
27/06/95
Its not summer if your tongue isnt purple.
28/06/95
What does it mean when someone says to Give it the ol college try? It means you join your friends get some cheap beer order a pizza and forget about tomorrow. Thats not what it means! Where did YOU go to college? Never mind.
29/06/95
CAAAAAAALLLLLLVVINNNNN THAAAAATS EEENOUUGHHH. M-mom s-sure was m-movingg st-strangellly t-toddayy. Maybe shes right about how much sugar you put on that cereal.
30/06/95
Frank appraisal of your looks 50c. Any business? Not so far. But Im giving out lots of free samples.
01/07/95
What a lovely day for a hike! Its not so bad THIS way! No we wont carry you. Stop griping. This is so much work!
02/07/95
Guess whats short and ugly and wet all over! ... give up? The answer had better not be what I think it is ... squirt squirt squirt squirt! Yow! Squirt squirt squirt squirt! Bang bonk bing! Calvin! If youre going to tear around do it outside!! Okay okay ...
03/07/95
Look at this! Mom got me a book from the library. Thats nice. NICE?!? Its SUMMER! I only get three short months to goof off! Im not going to waste these precious days reading BOOKS! Summers are for vegetating! Thats why the TV shows are reruns and the movies are sequels! No wonder the flies come out. Heck everyone KNOWS its not entertainment unless you can sit in the dark and eat.
04/07/95
Hey are you reading that book Mom got from the library? Mm-hmm. Is it good? Do you like it? Is it exciting? Are you having fun? Shh. HOW COULD IT POSSIBLY BE FUN WHEN ITS SO QUIET?!?
05/07/95
While youre reading that boring book IM going to go do something fun. OK. Ill be having the time of my life while youre sitting here yawning and wishing you were... AIEE! Ill just kind of read over your shoulder OK? No. Go do something fun.
06/07/95
I read this library book you got me. What did you think of it? It really made me see things differently. Its given me a lot to think about. Im glad you enjoyed it. Its complicating my life. Dont get me any more.
07/07/95
Im writing a fund-raising letter. The secret to getting donations is to depict everyone who disagrees with you as the enemy. Then you explain how theyre systematically working to destroy everything you hold dear. Its a war of values! Rational discussion is hopeless! Compromise is unthinkable! Our only hope is well-funded antagonism so we need your money to keep up the fight! How cynically unconstructive. Enmity sells.
08/07/95
Happiness 10c. What do you give people for their ten cents? A water balloon in the kisser! You take their money and then soak them with a water balloon?? Right. Whose happiness are we talking about? Who went to all this trouble?!
09/07/95
Its another new morning for Mr. Monroe. He glances at the newspaper headlines over a cup of coffee and gets in his red sports car to go to work. Little does he realize its his last day on the face of the earth! Calvin drinks the magic elixer and begins an incredible transformation. Instantly he grows! Bigger and bigger! Higher and higher! He is now over 300 feet tall! The formula is a success! Calvin the mighty giant goes on a terrible rampage striking fear into the hearts of the populace! Nothing can stop him! Its panic in the streets! A town lies in ruins! No I wont buy you any more toy cars. I saw you! You deliberately stomped on those!
10/07/95
How tall are you?
11/07/95
OK the map says to turn left at this tree and walk 30 paces. ...29 ...30. Whats here? My map shows a big hole. Wouldnt it be faster to make the MAP to conform to the YARD? Are you in some sort of hurry?
12/07/95
YOU THINK YOURE SO DARN SMART!
13/07/95
Art isnt about ideas. Its about style. The most crucial career decision is picking a good ism so everyone knows how to categorize you without understanding your work. You do goofy drawings on the sidewalk. Right. Im a suburban post-modernist. Arent we all. I was going to be a neo-deconstructivist but Mom wouldnt let me.
14/07/95
Times are tough for us suburban post-modernists. How so? Well people seem to be reluctant to pay for sidewalk drawings that stay where they are and wash away in the rain. And nowadays nobody wants tax money to support art and corporates wont underwrite me because Im not famous enough to advertise their cultural enlightenment. Couldnt you support your art with another job? What you mean WORK?
15/07/95
People always make the mistake of thinking art is created for them. But really art is a private language for sophisticates to congratulate themselves on their superiority to the rest of the world. As my artists statement explains my work is utterly incomprehensible and is therefore full of deep significance. You misspelled Weltanschauung. A good artists statement says more than his art ever does.
16/07/95
Hey mom are you nervous? No ... why? Calvin go outside and quit bugging me! Calvin the bug buzzes off! Flying low over the grass he searches for dead meat! Up and over the flowers darting this way and that! Oh no! hes caught in a spider web! Thrashing about in a desperate bid for freedom he only becomes more entangled! Soon the spider will suck out his innards! Help! I was going to join you in the hammock but I think Ill forget it.
17/07/95
Nothing is permanent. Everything changes. Thats the one thing we know for sure in this world. But Im still going to gripe about it.
18/07/95
PLOOSH. How can something seem so plausible at the same time so idiotic in retrospect?
19/07/95
I refuse to take out the garbage! I have the right to do whatever I want all the time! No you dont. I dont? Well it sure OUGHT to be a right.
20/07/95
BU-UURRPPP. THPTHH! PHTBT! THBBPPTT! BU-UURRRPP. What are you doing? Im hoping theres a mockingbird around.
21/07/95
RRIINGG RRINGG. Hello? No my Dads not here right now. Will I take a message? I dont know - whats in it for ME? People always assume youre some kind of altruist.
22/07/95
Oh just so you know... I am the downhill tumble and roll champ king of the toad finders captain of the high altutude tree branch vista club second place finisher in the round the yard backward dash premier burper state division sodbuster and worm scout first order and generalissimo of the mud ad mayhem society! Busy day? About usual. Want to hear what Hobbes is?
23/07/95
Boy its quiet around here today! Too quiet! Ha ha! Gotcha! Hey! ... rrrrrr ... squeak. Whoosh! Ha ha! Gotcha back! Hey! Sploosh! A water balloon! That dirty tiger escalated the war! This calls for supreme retaliation! Ill get him with the garden hose! Nothing can beat a hose for sheer volume of water! ... unless of course he went so far as to ...
24/07/95
People ask why we tolerate a popular culture that celebrates violence and depravity. Because its entertaining thats why! If warped values are the price of a vicarious thrill so be it! Let the business respond to consumer demand! The customer is always right. Shock and titillate me! Ive got money!
25/07/95
Popular culture isnt to blame for selling twisted values. Movies records and TV shows reflect the reality of our times. Artists depict hatred and violence because thats what they see. Why dont they see things of beauty and value? Because boring stuff doesnt sell. Such vision and integrity. Theres nothing like a good gunfight to uplift the spirit.
26/07/95
Another thing to remember about popular culture is that todays TV-reared audience is hip and sophisticated. This stuff doesnt affect us. We can separate fact from fiction. We understand satire and irony. Were detached and jaded viewers who arent influenced by what we watch. I think I hear advertisers laughing. Hold on I need to inflate my basketball shoes.
27/07/95
Onward came the meteors!
28/07/95
Bugs get on my nerves! The dizzy way they zip around the high-pitched noise they make their pesky size... everything about them is annoying! ... said the hyperactive whiny small child.
29/07/95
I want you to pick up your room today OK? Do I get paid? No. If I dont get paid how do I know its important?! You can trust a monther on that.
30/07/95
Go on three ok? One ... Two ... Two and a half ... Ready ... Set ... Go! Pit Pat Pit Pat Pit Pat Pit Pat. Pittida Dittida Pittida Dittida. Chooga Chooga Chooga. Eeewyeeowww. Gasp. I cant believe it! No sonic boom! Not even a pop! I heard a pop. But I think it was my lungs.
31/07/95
MY water balloon is round and aerodynamic for grim accuracy and certain soaking! YOUR water balloon is long and floppy impossible to throw the slightest distance! The advantage is clearly mine! Do you surrender?
01/08/95
Hey theres no butter in the butter dish! My toast will get cold while I get another stick from the fridge! HAVENT I SUFFERED ENOUGH?? WHERE WILL IT ALL END?!? Mr. and Mrs. Empathy.
02/08/95
Im glad youre getting some exercise. Keep that heart rate up. Dad can take the fun out of ANYthing.
03/08/95
I have a hammer! I can put things together! I can knock things apart! I can alter my environment at will and make an incredible din all the while! Ah its great to be male!
04/08/95
Vampire bugs! Run for your life! Theyre called mosquitos. So if they drink your blood you dont turn into one?
05/08/95
When a person pauses in mid-sentence to choose a word thats the best time to jump in and change the subject! Its like an interception in football! You grab the other guys idea and run the opposite way with it! The more sentences you complete the higher your score! The idea is to block the other guys thoughts and express your own! Thats how you win! Conversations arent contests! OK a point for you but Im still ahead.
06/08/95
You know Dad. It disturbs me that this wagon has no seat belts and wouldnt survive a 30 MPH impact with a stationary object. Um ... why do you bring this up? Oh no reason. Want to help me test the theory of relativity? Sure. The idea is that the faster we go the slower time goes. Gotcha. Its 10:23. What time is it now? 10:24. Go faster. Were going pretty fast! What time is it? 10:25 time still hasnt stopped. Has time stopped now? No just my heart. Well it looks like Einsteins a fraud wouldnt you say? No hes right! Look my watch isnt going at all any more!!
07/08/95
Just once Id like to see you manage this during the school year. YAAAAAAA.
08/08/95
Almost everywhere you go you can hear people radios and all kinds of engines. When youre actually confronted with the stillness of nature its kind of startling. Why you can even hear yourself think. This is making me nervous. Lets go in.
09/08/95
We rely on sight to confirm the existence of things. We dont believe in things we cant see. So how do we know that no-see-ums exist? Verification is ruled out by definition! Its an ontological quandary. Hold still a moment. Ooh I itch! Glad I could help.
10/08/95
Calvin time to come in! Aww Mom its not even dark yet! I didnt say it was. I said its time to come in. Its a cruel season that makes you get ready for bed while its light out.
11/08/95
Some people are pragmatists taking things as they come and making the best of the choices available. Some people are idealists standing for principle and refusing to compromise. And some people just act on any whim that enters their heads. I wonder which YOU are. I pragmatically turn my whims into principles!
12/08/95
To help Mom prepare better meals Im compiling a book of recipes. I notice that all of them involve deep-fat frying. Im adding a chocolate syrup section now.
13/08/95
Wanna toss the ol pigskin around? Heck no. Phooey. The center snaps the ball! The quarterback looks for an opening! The defense disintegrates beneath the coming onslaught! The quarterback jumps and dodges! Hobbes breaks clear! Calvin passes! An amazing catch! Hobbes is at the 30 ... the 20 ... the 10 ... but hes tackled from behind and laterals to Calvin so he can make the touchdown! But Calvin fumbles the ball and Hobbes recovers it! But a penalty is called on the play and Hobbes is sent to the bench! Hobbes defects to the other team and is greeted with enthusiastic cheers! The crowd goes wild! Calvin prepares to cripple the traitor with an illegal face mask pull! Hobbes defies him by pouring out of his mouth guard onto Calvin helmet! Boy you can see why football is such a violent game! Hobbes team gains a yard! All the cheerleaders come out for smooches!!
14/08/95
Its hard to conceal a water balloon.
15/08/95
Ive got a water balloon hidden under this turban! Pretty ingenious huh? Ill bet the tower comes in handy. Why?
16/08/95
Couldnt I be sedated for this?! Oh dont I wish.
17/08/95
It used to be that if a client wanted something done in a week it was considered a rush job and hed be lucky to get it. Now with modems faxes and car phones everybody wants everything instantly! Improved technology just increases expectations. These machines dont make life easier - they make life more harrassed. Six minutes to microwave this?? Whos got that kind of time?! If we wanted more leisure wed invent machines that do things LESS efficiently.
18/08/95
Summer is butter on your chin and corn mush between every tooth. It was nice of your parents to let us eat outside.
19/08/95
...ewww... Ah! Ah! CHOO! This food is allergic to me.
20/08/95
Gravity is arbitrary! Calvin wakes up one day to find he is immune to the force of gravity. He hangs on to the ground for dear life but his grip is weakening! He cant hold on! He ... he lets go! Aaaaa. Higher and higher as upward he falls! Only by grabbing the tail pin of a passing jet does Calvin save himself from being hurled out into space! No no let him finish. This is very interesting so after you landed in Phoenix what happened? Well I dont care. Im not sewing velcro on the outside of all his clothes. Well about then my gravity came back so I ...
21/08/95
Im a firefly. I see the flashlight.
22/08/95
Do we have any string? Sure. What for? A wick. Im saving all my ear wax to make a candle. Oh Calvin! BLAUGHH! Could I make a set of crayons?
23/08/95
Im filling out a reader survey for Chewing magazine. See they asked how much money I spend on gum each week so I wrote $500. For my age I put 43. And when they asked what my favorite flavor is I wrote garlic/curry. This magazine should have some amusing ads soon. I love messing with data.
24/08/95
Ever notice how people always try to do two things at once? They talk on the phone while they drive they watch TV while they eat they listen to music while they work... People never focus on any one thing to enjoy it or do it well. Youre breaking my concentration. WE focus on doing nothing at all!
25/08/95
I cant believe summer is almost over. Soon school will start. No more freedom no more long days outside no more fun. Well lets go make the most of the time we have left! Nah Ive reserved the rest of the month for moping.
26/08/95
Heh heh! If I miss this target THIS water balloon is reusable! Bad idea.
27/08/95
Do you think boogeymen really exist? I dont know. ... but if they do Im sure this is where they live. That was the creepiest campfire story Ive ever heard. Lets get back to the tent! I dont think Ill ever sleep again. Shh! What? Did you hear something?? Didnt you? I dont know. What did it sound like? Sort of like breathing and drooling and ripping the meat off human bones. Yaahhhh. You were right. Im glad we carried a generator all this distance.
28/08/95
Look! A quarter!! Wow! Im rich beyond my dreams! I can have anything I want! All my prayers have been answered! Maybe there/s more.
29/08/95
Id build a raft for this pond but I dont have a place to dock it. Ive always said youre a friend without pier. Huh? Nothing. Mm. I guess youre under a lot of pier pressure. Is something wrong with you?!
30/08/95
Heres Stinky the talking sock! Hi Stinky! Say something to Susie! Hello you ugly bucket of boogers! That darn Throw your voice ad made it sound like everyone would be fooled.
31/08/95
There arent many heroes these days. Who is out there to inspire us with a personal example of virtue and self-sacrifice in the name of a higher good? Who can we look up to? Business leaders? Sports figures? Politicians? Celebrities? Heck were lucky if they dont end up in prison! Fortunately if we cant get inspiration well accept entertainment. As usual the hero business is up to me.
01/09/95
Hello? Mm-hmm... No thank you Im not interested. Hmm? ... no I dont want... mm... as I said I dont... mm-hmmm... no I... mm... look Im not... hmm? DID IT EVER OCCUR TO YOU THAT I HAVE A LIFE BEYOND THIS SALES PITCH AND YOURE INTRUDING ON IT?! There would be more civility in this world if people didnt take it as an invitation to walk on you. Im only civil because I dont know any swear words.
02/09/95
Hold it. Wait I need to... KACHOOO! Wow this is your best drivers license photo EVER! Until this expires I will be driving EXACTLY the speed limit!
03/09/95
Spaceman Spiff is hit! Hes going down! Fortunately our hero always buckles up! The fearless Spaceman Spiff has crashed on a distant world! The planets atmosphere is thick with noxious fumes and gases! Our hero can hardly breathe. Spiff must find help quickly ... but is there any life on this hostile world? His question is answered when a hideous blob of of gelatinous muck oozes out of a crevice toward him! Spiffs blaster is useless against the slime! Our hero tries to escape but the suffocating stench envelops him! What a disgusting fate! Yechh! I sure wish Id brought my lunch today! Thats gross Calvin! If you dont like the cafeterias tapioca just leave it alone!
04/09/95
Hobbes is allowed to eat at the table with me tonight? And we get to eat early and have grilled cheese sandwiches? This is more like it! Boy you look nice. Thank you. ...uh-oh. Dibs on the French fries.
05/09/95
Calvin if you run these stockings...! Dear grab him! NO! NO! NOT ROSALYN! AAAAAAAAAAA! HELP! DONT LEAVE ME!! ... and the neighbors numbers are (pull a leg will you?) by the phone. I told you my rates doubled right?
06/09/95
OK Calvin listen up. Aaa! No! Im not going to bed! You cant make me! You and I are going to make a deal. A deal?! What kind of deal?? Im not making any deal! You dont give me ANY trouble tonight and well play a game. Whats the game? Kill the kid?! No way! Plus you get to stay up half an hour past your bedtime. Notice how obediently Im sitting here.
07/09/95
So whats the game I get to play if Im good? You decide. Pick your favorite game. Is this a trick? Can we really play my favorite game?? Sure why not? What is it? CALVINBALL!! CALVINball?? Get out the time-fracture wickets Hobbes! Were gonna play Calvinball! What the heck is Calvinball?
08/09/95
And if I do all my homework we get to stay up an extra half hour to play Calvinball! Oh boy! Here you can double-check my math problems while I start on my history. Weve got to get this done. You finished your math?? Were here to have a nice time. Try not to think about all the trouble Calvins getting into. Did you hear that?? It sounded like another sier.
09/09/95
I finished all my homework just like you said to Rosalyn. Great. are you ready to play your game then? First we need to make you a mask. A mask? what for? When you play Calvinball you wear a mask. Why? Sorry no ones allowed to question the masks. This sounds like a great game.
10/09/95
Dont turn out the light Dad! You didnt check under the bed for monsters! Im sure there are no monsters under your bed go to sleep. Good night. Good-bye. Any monsters under my bed tonight? Theres no answer. Do you think theyre gone? Maybe theyre just staying queit. Keep watch over the side of the bed. Boy am I full! I mustve gained ten pounds today! Maybe Im getting a little plump! Youre bigger Calvin but theres no fat on you! I guess youre right. Im getting big but Im still nice and lean! Ugh. Something under the bed is drooling. Start tying the sheets together. Well go out the window.
11/09/95
Other kids games are all such a bore! Theyve got to have rules and they gotta keep score! Calvinball is better by far! Its never the same! Its always bizarre! You dont need a team or a referree! You know that its great cause its named after me! If you wanna.... Uh feel free to harmonize with Hobbes on the rumma tum tums. This was a mistake.
12/09/95
Ive got the Calvinball! Everybody else has to go in slow motion now! Wait a minute Calvin. I dont... You have to TALK in slow motion liiike thisss. Thiisss gaaaame maaakes noooo sennnse! Itssss aasss iffff yourrrre maaakinnnggg iiiiit uuuup aaas youuu gooo. Hobbes! She stumbled into the perimeter of wisdom! Run!! OH...
13/09/95
If Im in the perimeter of wisdom then I get to make a decree. A decree? Um... OK. I decree that you have to catch a water balloon that I throw high in the air. Oh NO! Man she picked up the nuances of this game FAST! Ha! This IS fun!
14/09/95
OK Calvin you have to catch the water balloon! AAA! Ha Im in the corollary zone! If I catch the balloon the thrower has to bend over and hold still! WHAT?! I CAUGHT IT!! HA HA HA HA! Oh this is going to be SWEET! Im taking Hobbes prisoner!
15/09/95
Hobbes! Dont guard Rosalyn! Im going to get her with this balloon! The tiger is my prisoner! I guess Ill just have to soak you BOTH then! Ha ha ha! Sorry Calvin I touched you with the babysitter flag. The babysitter flag?? Whats that? It means you must obey the babysitter. ...who says its a half-hour past your bedtime now. Lets go in. Awwwww! Darn babysitter flag.
16/09/95
Our house is still standing. Thats a good sign. Were home! Is everything OK? Fine. Calvin did his homework then we played a game and Calvin went to bed. Its awfully late for jokes Rosalyn. Ive noticed that when we play games with girls you get captured a lot. Some of us are just irresistable.
17/09/95
Quit squirming Calvin. Youve got ice cream all over your shirt. Rats I was saving it for later. Thanks for the ice cream Dad. It was great. Youre welcome. Im tired of pulling you. Its my turn to ride. Your Dad didnt get me any ice cream so I get to ride both ways. No you dont! Dad said tigers dont like ice cream! Its my turn to ride! Tigers dont know if they like ice cream until they try every kind. Im not pulling. Ive got news fuzz brain. Im not pulling either! Well then I guess well both just sit here until we die. Why do these walks always end up as rides? oh you need the exercise more anyway.
18/09/95
Wake up! Its time to get ready for school. Just checking. Im glad youre up and dressed. That should throw her off the trail for a while.
19/09/95
For show and tell I brought a little toy airplane. Its sort of ordinary I suppose. But I like to have it around. It reminds me that as soon as I save a little more money Ill buy a ticket and put so much distance between you chumps and me it will boggle your minds. Its not an attitude. Its a fact.
20/09/95
Original flavor ... wait heres Less sodium and heres Lite and heres Less fat. What if I wanted less fat AND less salt? What distinguishes Lite from these others? Does the Original flavor package imply that the others taste different? Frankly my life was plenty complicated BEFORE the potato chips.
21/09/95
Look at all this peanut butter! There must be three sizes of five brands of four consistencies! Who demands this much choice?? I know! Ill quite my job and devote my life to choosing peanut butter! Is chunky chunky enough or do I need EXTRA chunky? Ill compare ingredients! Ill compare brands! Ill compare sizes and prices! Maybe Ill drive around and see what OTHER stores have! So much selection and so little time! I think YOU should do the shopping. Did the manager have to talk to you again? Hey wheres the peanut butter?!
22/09/95
Ook ook ee! Ooh! Ook. In humor timing is everything.
23/09/95
I like cereal to crackle and pop when I put milk on it. See? Very entertaining. Ive never seen raisin bran do that. I put in an alka-seltzer.
24/09/95
Im hungry whens lunch? Right now. Hi Susie! Oh look youve got your stuffed tiger! Can I squeeze him? What are you crazy? Hobbes is a ferocious man-eating jungle beast! Ferocious? He looks fuzzy and cuddly to me! Ha! Beneath that soft exterior lie terrible mandibles of bone crushing death! Hell grind you into hamburger! Each mighty paw hides razor-sharp claws to rip the living hide off any human that wanders too close! Hes a monster! No hes not. Hes a big cutie. Oh no! I cant look!! ... so what happened to the mandibles of death. You sissy furball?!? I was beguiled by her feminine charms. Yow. Go soak your head.
25/09/95
I need your help Hobbes. Whats the problem? The teacher said my book report was terrible and I need to do it over. Really?? Obviously I need a cooler letterhead logo. Ill add more lance-toting tigers around the Calvin shield.
26/09/95
I hear were having a fire drill today. Right. Wow! How exciting! I cant wait! Do you know what to do? You bet! When do they pass out the gasoline?
27/09/95
And so after a three minute downpour he became ludicrously attired for the rest of the day.
28/09/95
Not everyone can get a foll isometric workout by just yawning.
29/09/95
I wish school would disappear forever right now! To make a bad day worse spend it wishing for the impossible.
30/09/95
Uh oh I feel a sneeze coming on. Aaa! No tissue! No hanky! I... ah.. ah.. ah.. KACHOO! Of my limited options this was probably the worst.
01/10/95
Were there dinosaurs when you were a kid dad? Oh sure! Your grandfather and I used to put on our leopard skins and hunt Brontosaurus for all the clan rituals. Listen buster I think Calvins grades are bad enough already dont you? The horrifying Tyrannosaurus lumbers across the prehistoric valley. The mighty dinosaur is a walking death machine! Only one other creature dares to challenge the terrible Tyrannosaurus! ... the savage Saber-Toothed Tiger! Gg mmf yow gzzzz mkn gbzz yow. Wake up! The meek Tyrannosaurus victim of an innocent misunderstanding tears like heck across the prehistoric valley.
02/10/95
Boy I hate school assignments! Miss Wormwood is out to destroy my life! What do you have to do? Make a leaf collection! What a dumb waste of time! How many leaves do you need? 50! I gotta collect 50 leaves! And just when I thought of a loophole the teacher said every leaf has to be a different kind. Shes got your number.
03/10/95
When do you need to present your leaf collection? In two weeks. Thats not so bad. You just need three or four leaves a day. Im not working on weekends. OK five leaves a day. And my weekdays are booked until next Thursday at 6pm! So you need 50 leaves an hour. See? Its impossible!
04/10/95
Heres a nice leaf! Do you want it for your collection? No. Why not? Its a beautiful afternoon! Im not going to waste it doing ridiculous busywork for school! But this would be one less leaf youd need to collect later. Yeah but its one MORE leaf than I need right now. Somehone its always right now until its later. Whatever THAT means.
05/10/95
Hi Calvin. Have you started your leaf collection yet? Ive been visualizing the conceptualisation process. Thats the hard part. IM almost done. Isnt it fun? Its like a treasure hunt! A treasure hunt?!? Are you crazy?? This is a stupid boring time-wasting forced assignment! This isnt fun! When life gives you a lemon make a lemonade. I say when life gives you a lemon wing it right back and add some lemons of your own!
06/10/95
Our leaf collections arent due for a week yet! How could you possibly be almost done?! I make it a game. I pretend its a contest to see how many leaves I can find each day. That way its not an assignment its fun! Did you know thats one of the ten warning signs of hopeless dweebism? Ill bet another sign is moving to the next grade each year.
07/10/95
The teacher reminded us that we only have a week left to finish our leaf collections so we ought to be half done now. You havent even started. Yeah but I work better under pressure. Actually you work ONLY under pressure. That way the work time is more miserable but theres less of it.
08/10/95
Now where did all the bed pillows go? This is gonna be soft! Krunch! Hey Hobbes! Cmon and jump in the leaves! Its fun! I dont know sometimes slugs hide under leaves. No they dont. Do they? Slugs? Ugh just imagine one of those slimy muckballs slipping up your pant leg! There might be dozens in there! There might? Aack ick ooh yecch! Thats the problem with nature. Somethings always stinging you or oozing mucous on you. Lets go watch TV. Is it 3 oclock yet? We can watch The Blob!
09/10/95
Mom I need to collect leaves for a school project. Could we go to the arboretum sometime? Sure. How about this weekend? Um it would be better to do it a little sooner. When is this due? Well my notebooks in the car and the park closes in 20 minutes. Calvin Im fixing dinner!
10/10/95
My leaf collection is doomed! I cant believe Mom wouldnt take me to the arboretum. No wonder I get bad grades! Well you did spring the idea on her at the last second... Thats when I thought of it! The problem is that Moms not flexible. What a stupid waste of time this is! I wish there was some way out of this assignment.
11/10/95
A UFO!! Take us to the Supreme Earthling Potentate. Um... well... Speaking. Ah! What luck. It was I who chose the landing site. Kudos for Navigator Nebular!
12/10/95
So uh what can I do for you? We are taking over your world. You are?? What for?? Earth is prime real estate. Location location location. I guess Id never thought about that. Charm atmosphere quiet galaxy... Actually the atmosphere needs cleaning. A good fixer upper.
13/10/95
As Supreme Earthling Potentate Im afraid I cant let you just come in and take over the planet. You make this difficult. Prepare for war. Lets not be hasty. Ill trade you Earth for 50 alien tree leaves. Pst! These primitive fools must use leaves as currncy! Its a deal! I need them by 8:00 tonight and they have to be properly identified and labeled. Hurry Nebular! At light speed we can just make it! our leader will be most pleased.
14/10/95
Youre trading the Earth for 50 alien tree leaves?! Ill have the coolest project in the class! And best of all we dont need to waste any more time on this! The aliens are doing all the work! We can goof off the rest of the day! But then the aliens take over the Earth. Well its not like the grownups have done such a bang-up job.
15/10/95
... so if you capture the other guys flag and make it back to your territory you win. Win what? The game. No luggage? No toaster oven? Hey you cant hide your flag in a tree! Its too hard to capture! Thats not a rule. I can hide my flag anywhere! Well its a rule now! From now on no flags in trees! Ok but I just tagged you so you have to go to jail. What?? Its a time out! I was making a new rule! You didnt officially call a time out. Off to jail with you! Forget it! From now on if you are discussing a new rule its automatically a time out. Ok time in! Tag! You cant do that! We have to say time in together! Since when?? Youre just changing rules so youll win! I am not! Im just trying to keep you from cheating! Just a minute. Muffin head. Are you calling me a cheater? Whos a muffin head! Yowp! Arrgh! Oatmeal face! Strudel brain! Mom says we should take up Monopoly. No way buster. I know all about those interest free bank loans to yourself!
16/10/95
Hey no TV until your leaf collection is done. Its getting done as we speak. Whats that supposed to mean? Lets see it. I cant show you until later tonight. Why not? You should probably sit down. man she didnt even want to HEAR about it.
17/10/95
Its almost bedtime and the aliens havent come back with the leaves. Its a long trip. What if they dont show up? They SAID they would. Maybe they got lost. Space aliens dont get lost! Theyve got superior technology! Everybody knows that! Its a big universe. Ill turn on some more lights.
18/10/95
The aliens still havent shown up! What are we going to do?? Ive got to turn in my leaf collection tomorrow! Ill bet those dumb aliens got back to their planet and procrastinated! Ill bet they have no respect for deadlines! Ill bet they put everything off and are doing a lousy job at the last second! How could anyone be so irresponsible? If theyre not here in five minutes Im not handing over the Earth! Theyve got to learn a lesson!
19/10/95
Look! I see headlights coming over the trees! The aliens are back! Man its about time! Cmon lets go get my leaf collection! Youre out collecting LEAVES at THIS hour in your PAJAMAS?!? Get back in bed!! I TOLD you! Space aliens gave me these! They just left!
20/10/95
Boy you look tired. Ill bet you were up late doing your leaf collection. Maybe but IVE got the best collection of all! MY leaves are from another planet! What?! See how bizarre they are? The labels are even written in an alien language! Look at their cool alphabet! It looks like you took 50 maple leaves and cut them into weird shapes. Aliens now own the Earth and I told them girls make good zoo exhibits.
21/10/95
The teacher didnt believe my leaves were from an alien planet. She said it was obvious I did the whole thing last night and I made a mockery of the assignment. Well shell be sorry when the aliens send her to the plutonium mines. She just wont admit it was a pointless project. Who cares about leaves?! What useless knowledge! I believe thats poison sumac youre holding. This?? What makes you say that?
22/10/95
Enemy sighted! Battle stations! Battle stations! Alert! Ahwooga! Heres the mighty aircraft carrier! Equipped with the latest radar and firepower. It is virtually unsinkable! I know what can sink it. Yeah? What? A cannonball depth charge!! Oh no! Pfoom! Ha ha! That was great! You emptied the whole tub! Turn on the water and lets do it again! We seem to have a waterfall down the stairway dear. Ill go see what your kid is doing. My did?!? Cmere and let me explain something to you ...
23/10/95
No text
24/10/95
Hes at the 30... the 20... Calvins going for the touchdown! WAAA thwangg. Youre supposed to TACKLE me! I dunno... that seems so lowbrow.
25/10/95
You know school wouldnt be so bad if you didnt have to go every day. ... and if you didnt have to learn anything... and if you took away all the teachers and all the other kids. If it was completely different school would be great. A lot of things are like that. Nobody asks me how things ought to be. Ive got tons of ideas!
26/10/95
Yes Calvin? Hey kids on tomorrows show and tell Ill be bringing a big surprise! Will it shock you and amaze you... OR will it disgust and terrify you?? Find out tomorrow when I reveal my next SHOW AND TELL HORROR! Dont miss it! Returning to the LESSON.... Thats called a teaser by the way.
27/10/95
In the future everything will be effortless. Computers will take care of every task. Well just point to what we want done and click. Well never need to leave the climate-controlled comfort of our homes! No nuisance no wasted time no annoying human interaction... ...no life. Life is too inconvenient.
28/10/95
Youre going to juggle eggs? Its a metaphor for life Hobbes. Each egg represents one of lifes concerns and the goal is to give each the appropriate amount of individual attention while simultaneously watching and guiding all the others. Life is about balance and staying quick and alert as everything threatens to spin out of control! And sometimes we make a big mess of things. But the important thing is persistence.
29/10/95
Bang! Kapwinngg! Bang bang! You missed! You missed! There he goes! After him boys! Giddyap! Giddyap! Ambush! Bang! Bang! Yow! Whoop! Bang! Gotcha! Noyadidnt! Noyadidnt! Calvin will you please stop tearing around the house?! Youre driving me crazy! You said we couldnt go outside because its raining. Boy that sure worked. Were not allowed back in until when?
30/10/95
*KHHKHKT* Boy genius to fanged terror come in! Do you read me? Over! *KHKKHHKT* ILL take the walkie-talkie. YOU take the test. Ixsay inusmay ourfay! Urryhay!
31/10/95
Trick or treat! Wheres your costume? What are you supposed to be? Im yet another resource-consuming kid in an overpopulated planet raised to an alarming extent by Madison Avenue and Hollywood poised with my cynical and alienated peers to take over the world when youre old and weak! Am I scary or waht?
01/11/95
Bok whiff whaff fiff foof I cant help but wonder what kind of desperate straits would drive a man to invent this thing.
02/11/95
Look! Geese flying south for the winter. Twice a year they migrate thousands of miles across the continent in an exhausting eternal struggle to fulfill natures unyielding demands. Ill bet that gets old real fast. You dont see ME keeping a summer home.
03/11/95
Why isnt my life like this situation comedy? Why dont I have a bunch of friends with nothing to do but drop by and instigate wacky adventures? Why arent my conversations peppered with spontaneous witticisms? Why dont my friends demonstrate heartfelt concern for my well-being when I have problems? Why dont you know any gorgeous babes? I gotta get my life some writers.
04/11/95
Know whats weird? Day by day nothing seems to change but pretty soon everything is different. You just go about your business and one day you realize youre not the same person you used to be. People change whether they decide to or not! Thank heaven for small favors. For example I used to be more tolerant of oblique aspersions.
05/11/95
Zip zop Zip zop Zip zop Zip zop Zip zop Zip zop. Snow pants. Well? Lets have some snow!! Its snowing! I can make it snow! Im psychokinetic! Hey! Hey! Ohh hes going to hate me for this.
06/11/95
I wonder how long its been since I last looked at the clock. Maybe its been an hour. Well actually its probably been only 40 minutes. Ill guess half an hour to be safe. 20 seconds?!? Its going to be a very bad day. Calvin sit up.
07/11/95
IM IN A VERY CRABBY MOOD SO EVERYBODY JUST LEAVE ME ALONE! I HATE EVERYONE!! Nobody recognizes my hints to smother me with affection.
08/11/95
As a genius its important that I write a lot of letters. After all my correspondence will be the basic resource material for historians to reconstruct my life. My writing will provide countless fascinating insights for biographers. Such as how all your salutations begin Hey boogerbrain. Its been three weeks and I still havent received my X-Ray glasses!
09/11/95
Yikes! Not another extreme close-up on somebodys anguish and grief! Why do TV cameras zoom in so close to peoples faces that you cant even see their entire heads?! Do they think we cant read the persons expression from more than two inches away?! What a violation of personal space! What a shameless intrusion! What a heartless assault on human dignity! Why are you standing against the wall? Im watching TV.
10/11/95
AUGHH! THIS STUPID TOASTER BURNED MY TOAST!! Look at this! My toast is charred to a black cinder! I cant eat this! Its ruined! RUINED!! So stick in another piece of bread and watch it this time. Are you suggesting that this appliance didnt aggravate me with malice aforethought?!
11/11/95
I keep having the same weird dream every night. If its the same dream it must MEAN something. I think it means the fall season flopped and my subconscious went into reruns.
12/11/95
Can Hobbes and I come in the store with you Dad? No you stay in the car. Sheesh. Knock over one lousy display stand and pay for it the rest of your life. Ill just be a minute. Wait here. Ok. Lets hide and give Dad a scare! Maybe hell think we ran away! Lie down and Ill pull this blanket over us. Then put this bag on top. Hee hee! I hear him coming! Sshhh! Hee hee! Gee I wonder where Calvin went! And his tigers gone too! Nows my chance to get away before they get back! Wont Mom be glad when she hears I lost htem! Mom wont be glad at all you sicko! Sorry to spoil your getaway! What? Youre here?? Oh rats ... I mean good!
13/11/95
Brrr its freezing out there! I dont want to leave my nice warm bed. On days like this I wish Mom would come in lay an extra blanket over me pat my head and as I sink into the pillow under the weight of the covers shed say... HEY LETS MOVE IT!! THIS IS THE THIRD TIME IVE CALLED YOU! YOURE GOING TO MISS THE BUS! LETS GO!! These mornings are going to kill me.
14/11/95
The pace of modern life is all wrong. It makes every day an ordeal. Everybodys exhausted stressed out and short-tempered! Look at me! Why am I waiting for a bus at this horrible hour?! Its unnatural and unhealthy! We should EASE into the day! You know read the paper have some hot cocoa go for a leisurely walk and get our thoughts together... So now its mid-afternoon. Right. Time to kick back for a little siesta and plan dinner.
15/11/95
I want the last piece of pie! Dont divide it up! Give it all to ME! Dont be selfish Calvin. So the real message here is be dishonest?
16/11/95
Ugghh... manicotti! Gross! Shlooop. AIEE! MY INTESTINES JUST BURST THROUGH MY STOMACH WALL! AAAA!! I should get some more and see if I can get out of math class.
17/11/95
This is a photograph of me when I was two. Its strange. I KNOW thats me but I dont feel any connection to this image. Everything is so different now. Isnt it weird that ones own past can seem unreal? This is like looking at a picture of somebody else. Say a slobbering nudist with legs like link sausages. You know now I cant STAND to wad a soggy blanket in my mouth.
18/11/95
Heres a picture of me when I was three. Look at that smile! Ahh the arrogance of youth! I thought I knew everything when I was three. And you expwethed aww that knowwedge wike thith. Now a lifetime of experience has left me bitter and cynical.
19/11/95
A brilliant bolt of deadly frap ray blazes by the intrepid Spaceman Spiff! Our hero has very high insurance premiums. The courageous Spaceman Spiff is hit! He plummets toward planet Zog! Breaking through the cloud layer he careens over an alien city! Theres no place to land! Spiff wrestles the uncooperative controls! More freem drive to the thuster busters! Too much stress! The fuel explodes in flame! The situation is grim! Ten seconds to impact! Nine ... eight ... Well Calvin?? Seven! Very good Calvin. Ten minus three equals seven. I didnt think you were paying attention. That question was worth three points. Our hero miraculously makes a three-point landing. Spiff saves the day again!
20/11/95
Im gonna pound you at recess Twinky. Why?? Its no contest! Youve got the entire advantage! What could you possibly get out of pounding someone completely defenseless! Its fun. Oh hes a sportsman.
21/11/95
Hello? Hi Mom its Calvin. Is something wrong? Youre supposed to be in school! Its recess. Im fine. Then why are you calling me? Actually Im calling Hobbes. Would you put him on? I gotta get my own secretary.
22/11/95
Ooh its cold today! It needs to be 30 degrees warmer out here! For that matter its also too quiet. We need some background music. And its too slow! Things should happen more quickly! If only being outside were more like driving a car. Yeah I could be sitting down now too.
23/11/95
Calvin will you gather the trash please? Why should I? What do I get in return?! We will feed clothe shelter and educate you throughout your entire youth. I really hate having things put in perspective.
24/11/95
How could anyone wear out shoes so fast? I lead a rugged life.
25/11/95
I wish it would snow! I know when Im being mocked.
26/11/95
Im ready for bed Dad. Whats tonights story going to be? Heres one Readings on Dialectical Metaphysics. Youll love it. Forget it Dad. You cant get me to drop off that easy. Will you read us this story? Hobbes wrote it himself. Hobbes wrote it huh? Goldilocks and the three tigers. Oh boy this is gonna be great! Once upon a time there lived a young girl named Goldilocks. She went into the forest and saw a cottage. No one was home so she went in. Inside she saw three bowls of porridge. A big bowl a medium bowl and a small bowl. She was just about to taste the porridge when the three tigers came home. They quickly divided Goldilocks into big medium and small pieces and dunked them in the porridge that ... Calvin Im not going to finish this! This is disgusting!! I dont know why I let you talk to me into this. Good night! Click. He didnt even look at our illustrations. Now Im all hungry.
27/11/95
People keep talking about opening more wilderness for development. We seem to understand the value of oil timber minerals and housing but not the value of unspoiled beauty wildlife solitude and spiritual renewal. We need to start putting prices on the priceless. Yeah if your woods are worth a zillion jillion bagillion think what Alaska is worth.
28/11/95
Its freezing in here!! Why cant we crank up the thermostat?! Consuming less fuel is better for the economy and it saves money. Oh. ...and being cold builds character. I KNEW IT!!
29/11/95
These are interesting times. We dont trust the government we dont trust the legal system we dont trust the media and we dont trust each other! Weve undermined all authority and with it the basis for replacing it! Interesting is a mild way of putting it. Its like a six-year-olds dream come true!
30/11/95
Youre lisening to Boomer 102 classic rock - where we promise not to expose you to anything you havent heard a million times before! Well get right back to more hits from those high school days when your world stopped... but first heres our critic to review the latest movie based on a 60s or 70s TV show! Whats THAT look supposed to mean?
01/12/95
Ever notice how many conversations revolve around TV shows and movies? Our common references are events that never happened and people well never meet! We know more about celebrities and fictional characters than we know about our neighbors! That must be why new houses arent built with big front porches any more. I cant believe Dad wont let me have a TV in my own room.
02/12/95
I like the sound of sleet hitting the window panes at night. And I like when the sleet turns to heavy snow as it gets colder so you know that tomorrow the world will be buried in ice and snow! Its one of the few pleasures reserved for those who dont drive.
03/12/95
I spelled Be how many points do I get? Um ... 2 points. 2 points?! Is that @*#%! all?? My this game does teach new words! See I spelled zygomorphic on a triple word score box. Thats 150 points. All Ive got is consonants. Your turn. Well if I use your letter I I can spell in. Thats 3 points. I pick out some new letters ... hmm ... with your n I can spell nucleoplasm thats lets see 40 points. All Ive got is consonants. Im not going to play this stupid game! I hate it!! What a waste of time! What should we play instead? Lets play poker. At least with cards you have half a chance. Ok I bet a nickel. Ill see you ... and raise you 8 dollars.
04/12/95
I KNEW I shouldve thrown than snowball sooner!
05/12/95
Dear Santa Hi Its me Calvin. I have been extremely good* this year. Obviously youre hoping Santa wont read the long fine print disclosure in the footnote. I got the idea from car ads.
06/12/95
Dear Santa This year please bear in mind that I should be presumed innocent until proven guilty. Also I would encourage you to interpret reasonable doubt as broadly as possible. Thats probably a bad way to start.
07/12/95
Do you think theres an evil Santa? An EVIL Santa?? Yeah like Santas deranged twin brother or something! Hed make toys for all the BAD girls and boys! Evil Santa would give all the dangerous annoying and corrupting toys your parents wont allow! And if youre good? He punishes you with shirts and underwear.
08/12/95
Dear Santa Before I submit my life to your moral scrutiny I demand to know who made YOU the master of my fate?! Who are YOU to question my behavior huh??? What gives you the right?! Santa makes the toys so he gets to decide who to give them to. Oh. Time to prepare my appelate case.
09/12/95
I see you Calvin and youd better not throw that snowball! Im mailing a letter to Santa right now! Is the envelope already sealed? Yes but I could write a P.S. on the back. Do you have a pen? As a matter of fact I do. Ill bet shes bluffing but this isnt the time of year to tempt fate.
10/12/95
Run! Aiee! Look out! I wonder why Japanese people keep moving their moths after theyre through talking. Somewhere in the Pacific Ocean ... an undersea nuclear explosion awakens a giant prehistoric monster! It makes its way to the coast of Japan and emerges! Yaarghhh. He heads for the power lines leaving a trail of destruction behind. Calvin get back in the tub! Youre making a mess! His ancient arch-rival Megalon! He spews a mighty fireball! Aauughh! Tokyo is in ruins! Megalon vanquished! He returns to the sea from whence he came! No more afternoon TV movies for you! ... Ever!!
11/12/95
Theres a tree! Hit the brakes! Trees ARE my brakes.
12/12/95
I have 200 snowballs! I am utterly invincible! I can act with total impunity! I can do whatever I want! So just hang on while I decide what that is!
13/12/95
With 200 snowballs at my immediate disposal I have no opposition! My will is law! I am omnipotent! How boring.
14/12/95
In the SHORT term it would make me happy to go play outside. In the LONG term it would make me happier to do well at school and become successful. But in the VERY long term I know which will make better memories.
15/12/95
First she says go out. Now she says come in.
16/12/95
Ha! What a rotten snowman! Thats the worst snowman Ive ever seen! So go build a better one! Maybe I will! Youre back? MY words speak louder than actions.
17/12/95
Toboggans give better rides than runner sleds. Why is that? Theres no way to steer. On these cloudy winter days sometimes I like to lie back on my sled and look at the sky. Its just gray and silent. No birds singing or bugs buzzing. Everything is muffled by the snow. Imagine what it would be like without any people or houses around. It would be perfectly still. Pretty neat huh? Yes very peaceful. I hate all that silence.
18/12/95
The Christmas season is always a time for personal reflection. Too often we dont examine our lives. This is a time to take stock and think about whats important. Its a time to rededicate oneself to frenzied acquisition... a time to spread the joy of material wealth... a time to glorify personal excess of every kind! Earthly rewards make consumerism a popular religion. ...a time to atone for ones frugality!
19/12/95
Oh boy look at all the snow! It must be six inches deep! This will be perfect for sledding or... DING DONG DING DONG DING DONG All right! Im coming! Im coming! What the heck is wrong with this planet you sold us?!
20/12/95
Galaxoid and nebular! This cold white glop covers us and freezes our innards! Its snow. Youd better get used to it cause we get it every winter. You did not tell us that this planets axis would tilt away from the sun. You didnt ask. We paid 50 leaves for this planet! You greatly overcharged us! Yeah well let the buyer beware. You are a most dishonorable potentate! We demand you bring this planet up to code!
21/12/95
Whos at the door Calvin? AAHH! Um.. uh.. girl scouts! Do we want any cookies? Girl scouts? Cookies? It seems early but sure let me get my purse. Oh no! Scram you guys! Not until you fix the climate! Ill see what I can do. Do not trifle with us Earth leader! Where are the girl scouts? They suddenly had to go earn a merit badge. Quick wheres Hobbes?
22/12/95
The aliens didnt know about winter? They claim I sold them a planet with a faulty axis. What should I do? Offer a refund. Give back their leaf collection. Arrggh! I threw it away when it got such a bad grade! Hmm... well we should at least help them stay warm then. But what could they wear? They dont even have arms! ... they need huge socks or something. HEY! NO! Bad idea! Bad idea!
23/12/95
Ooh this is toasty! Thank you Earth leader! Thats my Christmas stocking! Theyre going away with our stockings! Santa cant fill em with loot! Im sure Santa knows we did a nice thing and hell work it all out. Hey yeah I did something GOOD! Were talking jackpot! Were talking multiple trips from the pole to haul it all! Your selflessness is the hope of the season.
24/12/95
What a day! And no one to share it with! Woo hoo hoo. Its cold out there today! Brrrr! Brisk! Just the way I like it! Wow! Sniff. Ha! Weather like this lets you know youre alive! Cmon out gang! Its a perfect day! Youll get used to the wind if you keep moving! Hey Cmon! are you guys just going to stay inside all day?!? Shut the dumb door!! Ok ok! I was on my way back outside anyway! ... sheesh ... theres one in every house. Just how long did you know Dad before you married him?
25/12/95
You say my present from you is outside? Its over here. A pile of ready-made snowballs! I wanted to give you something practical. Youre the best Hobbes ol buddy! Thanks! Merry Christmas. I suppose it would be wrong to throw these at YOU... I made my own pile just in case.
26/12/95
Whats this? A generic snowman. I used to make original snowmen but it was time-consuming hard work so I said heck this is crazy! Now I crank out crude imitations of whats already popular! It takes no time or thought and most people dont care about the difference anyway! So cynical yet so practical. And what good is originality if you cant crack it out?
27/12/95
The new issue of chewing tells how to stay in top chewing condition over winter! Whats so hard about that? You can chew gum all year. We serious chewers need a lot more than strong jaw muscles you know! To chew hour after hour we need a total cross-training fitness regime!
